It has been previously shown that GL is a dual NF-κB /STAT3 inhibitor, but nothing is known about its effects on cell cycle and DDR signaling in cancer cells. In this study, our results demonstrate that GL was able to induce cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M phase in human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC3), with similar results in other cancer cell lines like Jurkat and SK-N-SH (data not shown). Similarly, GL induces apoptosis in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells through activation of ATM/ATR-CHK1 signaling without inducing DNA break. Thus, GL may exert antitumoral activity at different levels: inhibiting the action of the pro-survival transcription factors STAT3/NF-κB, inducing DNA damage signaling pathway and inhibiting DNA repairing mechanism (Figure 9 ). However, further studies are required to confirm that G 2 /M cell cycle arrest and activation of ATM/ATR-signaling depend on these transcription factors. In summary, this study reports for the first time a new mechanism of action for GL, with important consequences on the damage response pathway in the context of its antitumor activities on prostate cancer. We demonstrate how fungal GL induces DDR via ATM/ATR-CHK1 pathway, causing apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer (Figure 9 ), inhibiting tumor growth in vivo in mouse tumor models. These findings validate GL as a promising antitumor agent for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer, alone or in combination with other drugs.
