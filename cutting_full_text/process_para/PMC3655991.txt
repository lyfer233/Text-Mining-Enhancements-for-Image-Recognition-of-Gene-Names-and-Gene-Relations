In Figure 7 , we have illustrated that mTORC1 plays a role in linking Cd/ROS signaling to IRE1 activation. However, this process may not be direct and could also be mediated by other signaling molecules. For example, a previous report showed that suppression of Akt was involved in mTORC1-induced activation of IRE1 [26] . Similarly, we cannot exclude a possibility that Cd-triggered IRE1 activation and apoptosis are mediated not only by mTORC1 but also by some mTORC1-independent mechanisms. In the present report, we disclosed a crucial role of the mTORC1–IRE1 pathway in the regulation of Cd-triggered apoptosis in vitro and in vivo . We found; 1) under the exposure to Cd, mTORC1 is activated through generation of ROS, 2) activation of mTORC1 selectively induces the IRE1 pathway, but not the PERK and ATF6 pathways, and 3) the IRE1–JNK pathway is the major pro-apoptotic pathway in Cd-triggered, mTORC1-mediated apoptosis, which is partially counteracted by the IRE1–XBP1 anti-apoptotic pathway. The outline of our current findings is illustrated in Figure 7 .
