To confirm that ERK1/2 is necessary for CDCP1 expression in TNBC cells, a panel of CDCP1-positive TNBC cell lines [ 3 ] was treated with UO126 under standard culture conditions for 24 h (Fig. 3d ). CDCP1 levels decreased in 5 of the 6 cell lines on treatment with this ERK1/2 inhibitor; only in MDA-MB-468 cells CDCP1 expression was unaffected by ERK1/2 inactivation. These data confirm the implication of ERK1/2 in the regulation of CDCP1 expression in TNBCs. A schematic representation of CDCP1 upregulation upon PDGF-BB, PDGFRβ pathway activation, via ERK1/2 is shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 Schematic representation of CDCP1 upregulation induced by PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ pathway through ERK1/2 activation. PDGFRβ dimerizes and is activated upon binding of the PDGF-BB ligand, causing the activation of the kinase domain, visualized as tyrosine phosphorylation (P) of the receptor molecules. In conjunction with dimerization and kinase activation, the receptor molecules undergoes a conformational changes, which allow a basal kinase activity, leading to full enzymatic activity directed toward downstream mediators such as ERK1/2. ERK1/2 activity is necessary for CDCP1 protein neo-synthesis, as demonstrated by the reduction of CDCP1 protein levels in presence of UO126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2
