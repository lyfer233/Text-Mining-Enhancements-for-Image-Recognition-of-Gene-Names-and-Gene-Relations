Here, we show that sCLU is up-regulated at a transcription level during both RS and SIPS, but is not elevated in response to oncogene-induced senescence. This is consistent with prior findings in the literature showing that sCLU was induced in WI-38 cells during RS or after H 2 O 2 -induced SIPS [19] , [21] . Mechanistically, we also demonstrated that sCLU was induced during senescence through the ATM/IGF-1/IGF-1R/MAPK/Erk-1/2/Egr-1 signaling pathway, a pathway that is also stimulated and regulates sCLU induction during DDR ( Figure 6 ). These results support the observation that cellular senescence processes share significant overlap with DDR pathways. And many key factors (e.g., ATM, p53, p21) that are involved in the DDR in human cells also play important roles in cellular senescence responses. Our results demonstrate that sCLU protects cells from senescence, suggesting that a role of increased sCLU expression in senescent cells is to counteract senescence by some as yet known mechanism. This result is consistent with the role of ATM in protecting cells from senescence. AT fibroblasts expressed low basal levels of sCLU, and failed to induce sCLU during senescence or DDR responses, due to the lack of ATM signaling ( Figure 3A ) that controls IGF-1 production [27] . Thus, the role of sCLU expression in DDR responses mirrors ATM, as both AT cells and cells knocked down for sCLU expression are hypersensitive to oxidative stress and senescence. AT patients also age faster [38] , [39] , [40] , and patients with lowered circulatory sCLU levels also age less well than Centenarians in a recent study [36] . Re-introduction of ATM into AT cells increased the lifespan of AT cells and restored sCLU induction responses after DDR or senescence induction pathways [27] . Collectively, these results suggest that sCLU may play a role(s) in aging. Furthermore, increased levels of sCLU may protect cells from senescence ( Figure 6 ). Importantly, our data clearly support a role for ATM in the induction of sCLU levels in senescent cells by controlling IGF-1 expression. Upon DNA damage, including uncapped telomere ends of extensive DNA lesions created in SIPS responses, ATM is recruited to the damage site and activated via phosphorylation [34] . Activated ATM, in turn, stimulates several proteins that can mediate DNA damage repair, cause transient growth arrest, and possibly lead to cell death or senescence. Ironically, loss of ATM function sensitizes cells to DNA damage, leading to enhanced cell death and possibly senescence. ATM can be activated by naked telomeres and trigger cellular senescence signaling during RS [7] , [11] , [35] . Similarly, ATM activation by overwhelming DSB lesions may also lead to senescence signaling during SIPS. However, ATM also plays a protective role in aging and cellular senescence, since ATM-deficient AT cells undergo senescence faster [38] , [39] , [40] . Consistently, AT patients also age faster. Our finding that ATM up-regulates and controls the IGF-1-sCLU expression axis [27] , as well as sCLU protecting cells from senescence, may help to explain the role of ATM in senescence/aging protection ( Figure 6 ).
