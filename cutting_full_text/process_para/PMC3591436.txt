The claudin family, integral components of tight junctions, are responsible for determining the permeability of paracellular transport within epithelial cell layers. The present study showed that MMP-9 might contribute to the degradation of claudin-5 in the blood-CSF barrier. MMP-9 production was correlated with claudin-5 degradation and blood-CSF barrier permeability in angiostrongyliasis meningoencephalitis. Therefore, we propose a possible mechanism ( Fig. 6 ) to explain the contribution of MMP-9 to blood-CSF barrier permeability. In mice infected with A. cantonensis , the parasite-induced eosinophilia and inflammation might lead to the induction of the phosphorylation levels of IκB-α and NF-κB. The activation of IκB-α and NF-κB could upregulate MMP-9 production. Blocking IκB-α and NF-κB signaling by MG132 could reduce MMP-9 production. Further, blocking MMP-9 activity by GM6001 could reduce claudin-5 degradation and blood-CSF barrier permeability during angiostrongyliasis meningoencephalitis. MMP-9 could cause claudin-5 degradation and promote leukocyte infiltration into CSF via the paracellular route during infection with A. cantonensis in mouse choroid plexus.
