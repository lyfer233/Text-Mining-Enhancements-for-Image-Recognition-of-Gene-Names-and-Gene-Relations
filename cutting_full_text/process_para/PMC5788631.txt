To determine how Hippo signaling changes during chronic IDD, we performed H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qPCR on tissues from 12-week postoperative rats. Surprisingly, the Hippo pathway was strongly activated and YAP phosphorylation was increased. These effects may be due the endogenous repair potential of acute IDD, which low self-repair ability is intrinsic nature [ 29 , 30 ]. Moreover, a CTGF post-transcriptional regulation mechanism, such as micro-ctfg, may be involved (Figure 12 ). YAP was not observed in the intervertebral discs of the P12w group in this study. Nevertheless, in the natural degeneration group, YAP levels in the NP and CE decreased gradually with age (Figure 13 ).
