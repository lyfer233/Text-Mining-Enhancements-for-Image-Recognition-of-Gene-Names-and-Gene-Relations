We report for the first time the molecular regulatory mechanisms of FSH in the inhibited development of cervical cancer. The inhibition is due to the decreased cell cycle and activation of cell apoptosis via the PKA-GSK-3β-NF-κB signaling pathway. After PKA is activated in the presence of FSH and GSK-3β activity is downregulated, inducing the inactivation of the NF-κB pathway ( Figure 4 ). Downstream of this process, CCND1, CCNE1, and CASP3 are important in regulating the cell number of cervical cancer. Our findings add to the knowledge of the regulation of cervical cancer and provide new data concerning estrogen replacement therapy for menopausal woman.
