DDR is activated in response to DNA injuries. Depending on the type and the extent of damage, DDR can drive cells into apoptosis or senescence, or allows cell survival by activating specific mechanisms such as DNA repair or DNA damage tolerance. The proteins involved in these signaling pathways ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ) are hierarchically classified into three categories: sensor and mediator proteins that recognize the lesion and generate the activation signal; transducer proteins that relay and amplify the initiated signal, and finally effector proteins that connect the signal activation with the cell cycle machinery [ 78 ]. The signal transduction pathways of the DDR that promotes cell cycle arrest during ongoing DNA synthesis will be designed as DNA Replication Checkpoint. ATR activated at arrested forks phosphorylates various substrates to coordinate cell cycle arrest, maintenance of replication fork stability, origin firing and eventually fork restart. ATR phosphorylates soluble substrates as well as chromatin bound substrates ( Figure 2 and Figure 4 ). Probably the best ATR characterized chromatin-bound substrate is the histone variant H2AX, known as γH2AX [ 148 ]. Phosphorylation of H2AX occurs by ATR after replication stress induced by aphidicolin, hydroxyurea or DNA distorting lesions, such as those induced by UV damage or cisplatin. An important function of H2AX phosphorylation at arrested forks appears to allow recruitment of the checkpoint mediator MDC1. Once recruited, MDC1 would act as a scaffold to recruit additional activated ATR molecules and propagate H2AX phosphorylation over a long distance, producing the characteristic pan nuclear staining observed by immunofluorescence [ 126 ]. Amongst other chromatin-bound ATR substrates there are MCM2-7 proteins [ 149 ], although the specific role of their phosphorylations remains unclear [ 150 ]. The RPA2 subunit of the RPA complex has also been shown to be phosphorylated by ATR upon replication stress [ 151 , 152 , 153 ]. Recent work has shown that phosphorylation mutants of RPA2 do not interfere with RPA binding to ssDNA and that this post-translational modification is not required for activation of the replication checkpoint in both Xenopus and human in vitro systems [ 154 , 155 ]. Another study suggests that this modification may be required to resume DNA synthesis facilitating replication fork restart [ 156 ]. Other replication substrates include subunits of the ORC complex, DNA polymerase ε, the RF-C complex and RPA1 [ 79 ]. In the future, it will be interesting to determine the role of these specific phosphorylations upon the structure/function of the replisome. Mrc1/Claspin can also be considered as a mediator of the replication checkpoint since mediates the autophosphorylation loop of the CHK1 protein kinase ([ 157 ] and see Section 5.6 ) by direct interaction [ 158 ]. Mrc1/Claspin is also phosphorylated by ATR and this phosphorylation appears to be important in mediating hyperphosphorylation of CHK1 [ 158 , 159 , 160 ]. Claspin/Mrc1 associates with two other proteins—Timeless/Tof1/Swi1 and Tipin/Swi3/Csm3—forming the Fork Protection Complex (FPC) that supports CHK1 phosphorylation [ 161 ]. FPC is bound to chromatin also during the unperturbed cell cycle and mutation in Mrc1 in yeast induce chronic replication fork uncoupling in the absence of external damage [ 136 ], suggesting an important role of FPC in coordinating helicase and DNA polymerases activities. Consistent with this conclusion, subunits of the FPC have been found to interact with MCM2-7 proteins [ 162 ] and RPA [ 163 ]. Interestingly it has been shown that Claspin binding to chromatin is not essential for CHK1 phosphorylation in Xenopus egg extracts [ 164 ], showing that both chromatin-bound and nuclear-soluble forms of the Claspin-CHK1 complex can exist and be functional.
