JNK regulates the activation of downstream pathways—both nuclear and non-nuclear—with activated JNK regulating nuclear substrates like c-Jun. c-Jun plays an important role in neuronal death under in vitro and in vivo conditions [ 67 ]. When phosphorylated by JNK, c-Jun participates in the activation of a dimeric transcription factor known as activating protein-1 (AP-1). AP-1 modulates the transcription of a number of genes, such as Fas ligand ( FasL ) [ 68 ], dp5 [ 69 ], and Bim [ 70 ], all of which may contribute to JNK-dependent neuronal death ( Figure 1 ). Apart from the nuclear pathway, JNK also regulates the activation of non-nuclear substrates, and thereby promotes cell death. In 6-OHDA PD models, JNK3 enhances the phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins and promotes Bax translocation to the mitochondria. It causes the release of cytochrome c and increases caspase-3 activation [ 71 , 72 ].
