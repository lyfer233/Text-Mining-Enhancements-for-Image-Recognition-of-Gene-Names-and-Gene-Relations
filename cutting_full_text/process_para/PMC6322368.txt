PKC is a family of serine/threonine kinases that has many different isotypes. The classical PKCα isoform in ECs, which contains calcium-binding domains, has an important role in pulmonary edema [ 16 – 18 ]. Our study suggests that 18% cyclic stretching and large tidal volume ventilation induced PKCα expression in in vitro and in vivo models. PKCα are activated by signals such as increased cytosolic Ca 2+ [ 16 ]. We found that PKCα expression was reduced after BTP2 pretreatment. Possibly because of decreasing Ca 2+ , PKCα was not activated. Activation of PKCα is accompanied by translocation to the plasma membrane [ 39 ]; unfortunately, we did not examine PKCα translocation. We speculate that Stim1/Orai1 regulates vascular permeability via the calcium-sensitive PKCα signaling pathway ( Figure 8 ). However, further study is needed to verify that activated PKCα not only depends on increase of expression, but also on increase of function.
