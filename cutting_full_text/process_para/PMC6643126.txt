In the current study, we proved that hypoxic environment promoted KF migration by activating HIF-1α-induced EMT. Metformin inhibits hypoxia-induced EMT of KFs via the HIF-1α/PKM2 signaling pathway (Figure 5 ). Based on these data, we propose that the HIF-1α/PKM2 pathway is involved in hypoxia-induced EMT in keloids. Therefore, metformin may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of keloids.
