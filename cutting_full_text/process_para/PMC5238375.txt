In the current study, we used an MI-induced rat model of cardiac fibrosis. The results showed that myocardial injury activated the AT1R/p38 MAPK pathway that disrupted the ACE/ACE2 ratio and further imbalanced the ACE-Ang II-AT1R and ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axes (including increases in ACE, Ang II, and AT1R, and decreases in ACE2, Ang(1-7), and Mas). Moreover, increasing Ang II and decreasing Ang(1-7) synergistically inhibited LXR-α expression. Consequently, the decrease of LXR-α further activated the AT1R/p38 MAPK pathway. This signalling created a positive feedback loop that amplified AT1R/p38 MAPK signalling, thereby disturbing the RAS balance and inducing cardiac fibrosis ( Fig. 2 ). Interestingly, pirfenidone (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2- [1 H]-pyridone, PFD) activated LXR-α expression, inhibited the AT1R/p38 MAPK pathway, and balanced the RAS in this rat model of cardiac fibrosis ( Fig. 2 ).
