A growing body of evidence suggests oxidative stress involvement in neurodegenerative diseases. 84 In addition, many papers showed the contribution of CyPA in oxidative stress mediated-diseases. 21 , 30 , 32 Recently Bell et al. 85 reported the involvement of CyPA in Alzheimer disease. In particular, they showed that astrocyte-derived human ApoE4 leads to an age-dependent progressive blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown ( Figure 5 ). This event is driven by CyPA that initiates a pro-inflammatory pathway activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF- κ B) and MMP-9. The activation of this pro-inflammatory pathway in brain capillary pericytes determines the release of neurotoxic molecules from the vessels, damaging neurons and affecting their synaptic connections.
