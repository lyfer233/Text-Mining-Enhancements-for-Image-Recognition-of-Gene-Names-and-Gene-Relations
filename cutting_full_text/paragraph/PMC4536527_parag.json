    "Increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF in the plasma and chondrocytes in the HFD-feeding mice": {
        "p0": "To verify the positive correlation between obesity and OA, we set up an obese mouse model by feeding the mice with a HFD for 8 weeks. Consistent with previous studies 5 6 18 , HFD induced a low grade inflammation state, characterized by elevated production of IL-6 ( Fig. 1a ), TNF-α ( Fig. 1b ) and IL-1β ( Fig. 1c ) in plasma. Meanwhile, plasma VEGF, a well-documented risk factor of OA, was also induced by HFD ( Fig. 1d ). Further, the expression pattern of chondrocyte cytokines was identical with the aforementioned ones in plasma ( Fig. 1e~h ). These results indicated that the HFD induced a low grade inflammation in the mouse cartilages. However, the 8 weeks of HFD-feeding mice didn’t display any signs of osteoarthritis in histomorphology (see  Supplementary Fig. S1 )."

    "HFD-induced plasma stearic acid and lactate stimulates proinflammatory cytokine and VEGF production in primary chondrocytes": {
        "p0": "To explore whether the serum-derived factors are contributors of the chondrocyte inflammation, we collected the serum from the mice with a normal diet (ND) or HFD for 8 weeks. The full serum was then separated into a protein fraction (>3 KD) and a metabolite fraction (<3 KD) to treat the primary chondrocytes from the ND-feeding mice. Comparing to the full serum, protein fraction and metabolite fraction from the ND group, the ones from HFD group notably stimulated mRNA expression of IL-6 ( Fig. 2a ), TNF-α ( Fig. 2b ) and IL-1β ( Fig. 2c ). Unexpectedly, the mRNA expression of VEGF was induced by the HFD group-derived full serum and metabolite fraction but not by the protein fraction ( Fig. 2d ). While it has been proven that proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, etc) are present at high levels in the protein fraction of serum from the HFD-feeding mice 5 6 , the proinflammatory molecules in the metabolite fraction of the serum are still not well-known. We performed metabonomics analysis of the metabolite fraction with GC-TOF-MS (see  Supplementary Table S1 ), and verified that at least two elevated metabolic molecules, stearic acid (a kind of saturated FFAs) and lactate in obesity, were functional stimulators of proinflammatory cytokine and VEGF production in primary chondrocytes ( Fig. 2e~l ). However, the molecular mechanism linking stearic acid and lactate to the cytokine production in chondrocytes will be further explored."

    "Stearic acid and lactate induced inflammation response by enhancing protein stability and transcription activity of HIF1α in chondrocytes": {
        "p0": "It’s well established that lactic acid is largely produced in hypoxia state, which increases stability and activity of HIF1α, a recently characterized enhancer of chronic inflammation in adipose tissue in obese mice 17 19 . Specially, stearic acid and lactate-induced VEGF is a well-known transcriptional target of HIF1α 20 . Thus, we presumed that stearic acid and lactate might regulate the protein stability and transcriptional activity of HIF1α. As expected, similar to hypoxia, both stearic acid and lactate induced protein levels ( Fig. 3a ), protein stability ( Fig. 3b~d ) and transcription activity ( Fig. 3f~h ) of HIF1α in primary chondrocytes. Furthermore, we confirmed that metabolite fraction of serum from the HFD-feeding mice notably induced HIF1α protein stability ( Fig. 3e ) and transcription activity ( Fig. 3i ).",
        "p1": "To verify whether stearic acid and lactate induced cytokine production through HIF1α, mouse HIF1α specific siRNAs were employed to silence the expression of HIF1α in primary mouse chondrocytes ( Fig. 4a ). As expected, stearic acid-induced production of IL-6 ( Fig. 4b ), TNF-α ( Fig. 4c ) and IL-1β ( Fig. 4d ) could be partly blocked by HIF1α silence, while stearic acid-stimulated VEGF expression was fully prevented by HIF1α deletion ( Fig. 4e ). In contrast, lactate-induced expression of IL-6 ( Fig. 4f ), TNF-α ( Fig. 4g ), IL-1β ( Fig. 4h ) and VEGF ( Fig. 4i ) could be fully diminished by HIF1α silence. Those results indicated that stearic acid mediated inflammation response partly through HIF1α, while lactate induced inflammation response in a HIF1α-dependent manner in chondrocytes."

    "Stearic acid potentiates LDH-a-dependent lactate production in chondrocytes": {
        "p0": "Given that both stearic acid and lactate could mimic the hypoxia state and regulate HIF1α activity, we presumed that there might be a reciprocal regulatory role between stearic acid and lactate. In primary mouse chondrocytes, lactate treatment exerted no effects on the production of free fatty acids ( Fig. 5a ), while the treatment with stearic acid notably induced lactate production ( Fig. 5b ). Further, we demonstrated that stearic acid could induce the expression of LDH-a, a key enzyme for lactate production ( Fig. 5c ). siRNA-mediated LDH-a silence abolished stearic acid-stimulated lactate production in primary mouse chondrocytes ( Fig. 5c~d ). To confirm the stimulatory role of stearic acid on lactate production via LDH-a, an inhibitor (Oxamate) of LDH-a activity was employed and identical results were obtained ( Fig. 5e  and  Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Furthermore,  in vivo  studies were performed to verify the aforementioned findings  in vitro . The HFD treatment stimulated the levels of free fatty acids ( Fig. 5f ) and lactate ( Fig. 5g ) in mouse plasma in a time-dependent manner. Likewise, the plasma VEGF exerted a similar altering pattern as free fatty acids and lactate ( Fig. 5h ). Interestingly, the HFD-induced lactate production was abolished by additional treatment with the LDH-a inhibitor Oxamate ( Fig. 5i )."

    "Stearic acid stimulates LDH-a-dependent production of proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF": {
        "p0": "Saturated free fatty acid is the well-documented stimulator of TLR4, mediating inflammation response ubiquitously 5 7 21 . To identify whether TLR4 is involved in LDH-a/lactate pathway-mediated cytokine production, stearic acid-induced inflammation response in primary chondrocytes with TLR4 or LDH-a silence was observed. Stearic acid-induced mRNA levels of IL-6 ( Fig. 6a ), TNF-α ( Fig. 6b ) and IL-1β ( Fig. 6c ) were largely decreased by a single silence of TLR4 (see  Supplementary Fig. S3a ) or LDH-a. Combined silence of TLR4 and LDH-a could fully prevent stearic acid-induced proinflammatory cytokine production ( Fig. 6a~c ). Thus we concluded that stearic acid/LDH-a/lactate pathway was TLR4-independent. Interestingly, stearic acid-stimulated VEGF expression was fully blocked by the silence of LDH-a, but not by TLR4 ( Fig. 6d ). To verify the aforementioned  in vitro  pathway (stearic acid/LDH-a/cytokines)  in vivo , we treated the HFD-feeding mice with inhibitors of TLR4 (see  Supplementary Fig. S3b ), LDH-a or HIF1α (see  Supplementary Fig. S3c ) and observed cytokine production in mouse cartilage. The HFD-feeding stimulated mRNA expression of IL-6 ( Fig. 6e ), TNF-α ( Fig. 6f ) and IL-1β ( Fig. 6g ), and this effect was partly attenuated by a single treatment of TLR4, LDH-a or HIF1α inhibitors ( Fig. 6e~g ). Simultaneous administration with TLR4 and LDH-a inhibitors fully prevented HFD-feeding-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in mouse cartilage ( Fig. 6e~g ). It should be noted that the HFD-feeding-stimulated VEGF expression was prevented by LDH-a or HIF1α inhibitors, but not by TLR4 inhibitor ( Fig. 6h ). These results verified that stearic acid/LDH-a/HIF1α was a TLR4-independent novel pathway in chondrocytes."

    "Positive correlation of plasma lactate, cartilage HIF1α and cytokine levels with the body mass index (BMI) in patients with OA": {
        "p0": "Aforementioned results revealed that lactate/HIF1α pathway was involved in saturated free fatty acid-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF. To further correlate this mechanism to physiological condition, we investigated the levels of plasma lactate, cartilage HIF1α and cytokines in age-matched female human donors with OA. Results revealed that production of plasma lactate ( Fig. 7a ), cartilage HIF1α ( Fig. 7b ), IL-6 ( Fig. 7c ), TNF-α ( Fig. 7d ), IL-1β ( Fig. 7e ) and VEGF ( Fig. 7f ) were positively correlated with the BMI in human donors."

    "Discussion": {
        "p0": "Obesity is causally linked to OA, with the molecular mechanism being not fully understood 2 22 . Biomechanics stress (overweight), cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, VEGF, etc) and hormones (leptin, etc) were identified as key risk factors linking obesity to the setup and progression of OA 9 10 . However, the metabolic changes in obesity affecting the cytokine production were still obscure. Here in this study, we are the first to demonstrate that stearic acid stimulated LDH-a-dependent production of lactate, which further stabilized HIF1α protein, and promoted OA-related cytokine expression in chondrocytes. Our work identified a novel pathway (LDH-a/HIF1α/cytokines) mediating saturated free fatty acid-induced cytokine production, independent of TLR4 signaling in chondrocytes.",
        "p1": "The levels of saturated free fatty acids (stearic acid, etc) in plasma were increased in obese individuals. Those saturated free fatty acids exerted proinflammatory roles through TLR4 in multiple cells, including monocytes, macrophages, adipocytes and chondrocytes 5 23 24 25 26 . In this study, we demonstrated that stearic acid-induced LDH-a/lactate axis was TLR4-independent. However, the precise mechanism linking free fatty acids to LDH-a expression is still not clear. Previous studies revealed that uptake of free fatty acids were increased in multiple cells in obesity 27 28 29 . We presumed that the chondrocytes might also be overloaded with fatty acids and the over-consumption of oxygen in fatty acid oxidation might generate a hypoxic circumstance, inducing LDH-a-dependent glycolysis and lactate production in chondrocytes.",
        "p2": "Lactate was known to stabilize HIF1α protein under normoxia conditions in a latest study 30 , which is consistent with our present work. The role of lactate in inflammation was contradicted in different cells 31 32 33 . Here we identified the proinflammatory role of lactate via HIF1α in chondrocytes. Interestingly, the production of lactate was tightly potentiated by saturated free fatty acid in obesity. Those findings indicated that lactate might also be a linker between obesity and OA. However, the precise mechanism of lactate stabilizing HIF1α protein needs further to be investigated.",
        "p3": "HIFs are pivotal transcriptional factors which are tightly regulated by oxygen concentration 16 . HIF1α and HIF2α regulate different subgroups of genes, although they share some common targets such as VEGF and GLUT1 16 . In arginine metabolism, HIF1α stimulated iNOS production, while HIF2α induced arginase expression 34 35 . In fat tissues of obese mice, HIF1α potentiated proinflammatory cytokine production, while HIF2α attenuated chronic inflammation and insulin resistance 19 36 . In the present study, we identified that HIF1α, could mediate stearic acid-stimulated inflammatory response in chondrocytes. The specific activation of stearic acid on HIF1α protein is interesting and needs further to be explored.",
        "p4": "In all, we identified that elevated circulatory metabolite stearic acid increased lactate levels in the plasma and chondrocytes in a LDH-a-dependent manner. The stearic acid stimulated VEGF and proinflammatory cytokine production through a canonic TLR4 pathway and a novel lactate/HIF1α pathway ( Fig. 8 ). The molecules in both pathways might be potential diagnostic markers and functional therapeutic targets."
