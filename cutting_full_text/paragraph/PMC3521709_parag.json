    "Introduction": {
        "p0": "The engulfment of apoptotic cells requires at least two processes to occur in the engulfing cell at the interface with the dying cell. Actin cytoskeletal elements need to be reorganized and membrane needs to be recruited. Together, these two processes result in the engulfing cell surrounding the dying cell. Two conserved molecular pathways were originally identified in  Caenorhabditis elegans  that are required for apoptotic cell engulfment and regulate these two processes.",
        "p1": "In the pathway for membrane recruitment, which we refer to as the CED-1 pathway, four proteins have been identified, CED-7, CED-1, CED-6 and DYN-1 ( Figure 1 )  [1] . These proteins activate DYN-1, a  C. elegans  dynamin homolog  [2] , which might recruit membrane for engulfment; in mammalian cells dynamin promotes extension of lamellipodial membrane protrusions  [3] .",
        "p2": "The pathway for cytoskeletal rearrangement requires the small GTPase CED-10 Rac, the adapter protein CED-2 and the heterodimeric guanine nucleotide exchange factor CED-5/CED-12. CED-2 is thought to activate CED-5/CED-12, which, in turn, activates CED-10 Rac. Rac proteins are members of the Rho family of small GTPases that regulate the cytoskeleton and function in intracellular signaling  [4] . CED-10 Rac activation causes actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and promotes engulfment  [5] ,  [6] .",
        "p3": "In addition to the two core engulfment pathways, more recent studies have identified a number of factors that regulate engulfment through these pathways. In  C. elegans , MIG-2, the mammalian homolog of RhoG, another Rho family GTPase activates CED-5/CED-12 in parallel to CED-2  [7] ,  [8] . The phosphatidylserine receptor PSR-1, the integrins INA-1 and PAT-3 and a WNT signaling pathway all appear to act upstream of CED-2  [9] ,  [10] . In  Drosophila , the Src protein Src42 and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Shark act through the CED-1 Draper pathway  [11] . Furthermore, Calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum by a junctophilin-containing complex is also required for CED-1 Draper activity  [12] ,  [13] .",
        "p4": "Recently, we reported that the cytoskeletal regulatory protein ABI-1 is also an engulfment protein  [14] . The mammalian homolog of ABI-1, Abi2, is found in a number of protein complexes, all of which regulate the actin cytoskeleton. One particular complex, the Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC) causes the formation of actin structures in response to activation by Rac  [15] ,  [16] . The WRC is composed of five proteins in  C. elegans : WVE-1, GEX-2, GEX-3, ABI-1 and NUO-3. Soto et al. (2002)  [17]  and Patel et al. (2008)  [18]  presented evidence that suggested that GEX-2 and WVE-1, respectively, promote engulfment. Our genetic analysis, however, demonstrated that the CED-10 Rac pathway and ABI-1 act at least partially independently of each other. Our current model, based on all of these data is that the CED-10 Rac pathway activates the WRC but that there are other as yet unidentified molecular pathways that activate the WRC in parallel.",
        "p5": "Far less studied are proteins that inhibit these two pathways. We showed that the tyrosine kinase and cytoskeletal regulator ABL-1 inhibits engulfment through ABI-1 in parallel to the CED-10 Rac pathway  [14] . A small number of other proteins have been shown to inhibit apoptotic cell engulfment (compared to 25 proteins that promote engulfment). In mammalian cell culture, the small GTPase RhoA and its effector Rho-kinase have been shown to inhibit engulfment of apoptotic cells  [19] , consistent with the fact that RhoA and Rac oppose each other in many cellular processes. How Rho-kinase inhibits engulfment has not been demonstrated. In  C. elegans , the Rac GTPase activating protein SRGP-1 inhibits engulfment by inactivating CED-10  [20] . The myotubularin lipid phosphatase MTM-1 and a CED-10 binding protein, SWAN-1, have also been shown to inhibit engulfment in  C. elegans [21] – [23] . They are both proposed to act through the CED-10 Rac pathway. Recently, PGRN-1, a  C. elegans  progranulin has been shown to act in engulfment  [24] . Notably, it is unclear how any of these proteins are regulated for their engulfment-inhibitory functions.",
        "p6": "Cbl family proteins are E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor proteins with multiple cellular functions  [25] . Cbl proteins consist of an N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain followed by a conserved linker, then a RING finger domain and a C-terminal proline rich domain. The TKB domain is comprised of three subdomains: a 4-helix bundle, an EF hand and a modified SH2 domain. The crystal structure of the TKB domain has revealed that the three subdomains act together to bind to phosphotyrosines  [26]  and orient substrate proteins (usually tyrosine kinases) to allow the RING finger to promote their ubiquitination, targeting them for destruction or sequestration. Thus a major function of Cbl proteins is to downregulate signaling pathways in response to interactions with tyrosine phosphorylated signaling proteins  [27] . Recent data show that Abi proteins are activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling and then in turn activate c-Cbl to polyubiquitinate the EGF receptor in a negative feedback regulatory loop  [28] . In  C. elegans,  the Cbl homolog SLI-1 downregulates EGF signaling by causing ubiquitination of the LET-23 EGFR  [29] ,  [30] , which decreases signaling from the downstream Ras homolog LET-60. Cbl has also been shown to interact with Rac, the CED-2-related protein Crk and Abl kinase  [31] – [33] . We hypothesized that SLI-1 might act in engulfment pathways. In addition, we asked whether it did so by interacting with the  C. elegans  homologs of the above proteins.",
        "p7": "We now present evidence that SLI-1 inhibits apoptotic cell engulfment. Surprisingly, we find that SLI-1 does so in parallel to the two core engulfment pathways and ABL-1 and independent of LET-60 Ras signaling. Lastly, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase domain is partially dispensable for this process demonstrating that its tyrosine kinase-ubiquitinating function is unrelated to its mechanism of action in engulfment."

    "SLI-1 inhibits apoptotic cell corpse engulfment": {
        "p0": "In animals with defects in apoptotic cell engulfment, the number of unengulfed corpses in the heads of first larval stage (L1) animals increases with the strength of the engulfment defect and defines a quantitative assay of engulfment defects  [34] . L1 wild-type (N2) animals have no unengulfed corpses in their heads. Neither do animals with  sli-1  mutations alone. We used two alleles of  sli-1  in this study,  sy143  and  n3538 [35] ,  [36] .  sy143  is a C to T transition that changes Gln152 to an amber stop codon;  n3538  is a C to T transition that changes Ser305 to Leu. To assess whether  sli-1  modulates apoptotic cell engulfment, we tested whether  sli-1  mutations suppressed or enhanced the engulfment defects of engulfment pathway genes.",
        "p1": "The heads of animals containing a mutation in  sli-1  and null mutations in  ced-1  or  ced-7  or a strong mutation in  ced-6  (alleles  e1735 ,  n1996  and  n2095 , respectively) had fewer unengulfed corpses than those with each of the engulfment mutants alone ( Table 1 ). We did not test  dyn-1  mutants because they die during embryogenesis. Thus, SLI-1 appears to inhibit the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Alternative explanations for the effect of SLI-1 on these engulfment defects are presented in the next section of the paper. The fact that loss of  sli-1  function suppresses the engulfment defects caused by null  ced-1, ced-6  and  ced-7  mutation demonstrates that SLI-1 acts in parallel to or downstream of the CED-1 pathway.",
        "p2": "Loss of  sli-1  function did not suppress the engulfment defects of null mutations in the CED-10 Rac pathway. Specifically, the engulfment defects of  ced-2(n5101), ced-5(n1812)  and  ced-12(n3261)  null mutants were not significantly modified by the presence of  sli-1(sy143)  or  sli-1(n3538)  mutations ( Table 1 ).  ced-10  null mutants die during embryogenesis but we tested the effect of  sli-1  mutations on a partial loss-of-function allele,  ced-10(n1993). ced-10(n1993)  was suppressed by  sli-1 (lf) (for  sy143 , a decrease from 20.0 to 14.1 unengulfed corpses,  p <0.0001; for  n3538,  a decrease to 13.8,  p <0.0001). Suppression of a  ced-10  partial loss-of-function defect by  sli-1  mutations is consistent with a general inhibition of engulfment by  sli-1  but suppression of a partial loss-of-function mutation cannot be used to order genes within genetic pathways. In summary,  sli-1 (lf) was not able to suppress the engulfment defects caused by complete loss-of-function CED-10 pathway mutants. Thus, the CED-10 Rac pathway is unlikely to act by inhibiting SLI-1; rather, SLI-1 acts either parallel to or upstream of the CED-10 Rac pathway."

        "p0": "sli-1  mutation might decrease the number of unengulfed cell corpses in engulfment mutants in a number of ways other than by suppressing apoptotic cell engulfment.  sli-1  mutation could (1) decrease programmed cell death, resulting in fewer cell corpses as is seen in  ced-3  caspase mutants  [37] , (2) alter the timing of corpse appearance during development like the protein CED-8  [38] , resulting in fewer corpses at the time of observation, (3) alter cell-corpse morphology so that they could not be identified by DIC microscopy as corpses or, (4) cause the corpses to be unstable and lost rapidly.",
        "p1": "To address whether  sli-1  normally prevents programmed cell death, we determined whether cells that are known to die by apoptosis normally during development do so in  sli-1  mutants. 16 cells undergo programmed cell death in the anterior pharynx during embryogenesis in wild-type animals  [39] . The nuclei of these cells are identified easily using DIC microscopy  [34] . Mutations in genes that normally cause cell death, such as  ced-3  or  ced-4 , have up to 14 extra recognizable cell nuclei in the anterior pharynx  [34] ,  [40] .  sli-1(sy143)  animals had no more nuclei than wild-type animals in their anterior pharynges ( Table 2 ,  sli-1  mutation does not block cell death in the pharynx). To test for apoptosis defects more stringently, we observed whether  sli-1  mutation enhanced the death defect of a partial loss-of-function  ced-3  mutant  (n2427) [41] . We observed no difference between  ced-3(n2427)  and  ced-3(n2427); sli-1(sy143)  animals (1.6 vs. 1.1 extra cells,  Table 2 ,  sli-1  mutation does not block cell death in the pharynx).",
        "p2": "We used time-lapse DIC microscopy to assess whether  sli-1  loss-of-function affected the timing, persistence or morphology of cell corpses. The development of wild-type and  sli-1(sy143)  animals was recorded for approximately 150 minutes. We found that  sli-1(sy143)  animals developed on average more slowly than wild-type animals. To account for the difference in the rate of development, we counted the number of cell deaths that occurred from the first cell death up to the comma stage.  sli-1(sy143)  worms take approximately 31 minutes longer than wild-type animals to develop to that stage at 20°C (144 minutes compared to 103 minutes). During this time, approximately 60–65 cell corpses appear in the wild-type animal. The number of cell corpses that appeared and when they appeared in wild-type and  sli-1(sy143)  embryos did not differ significantly ( Figure 2A ). However, the timing of appearance approaches statistical significance ( p  value = 0.053), probably related to the difference in developmental speed. The length of time that corpses persisted was similar in wild-type and  sli-1(sy143)  animals ( Figure 2B ). In addition, apoptotic cell corpses in wild-type and  sli-1(sy143)  animals looked similar ( Figure 2C ). We conclude that the morphology and time of appearance of apoptotic cell corpses is not affected by  sli-1  mutation."

Briefly,  sli-1ΔN  encodes the first 64 amino acids of SLI-1 followed by a short linker (Leu Ala Leu) and then amino acid (aa) 350 through the end of the protein (aa 583).  sli-1ΔRING  encodes the first 393 amino acids followed by the following linker (Glu Thr Gly Thr Thr Phe Glu) and then amino acid 432 through the end of the protein.  sli-1ΔC  encodes the first 447 amino acids of the protein. The P hsp gfp  plasmids have been described previously  [59] . Each minigene was expressed under the control of the  hsp16/2  and  hsp16/41  promoters. P hsp  plasmids were injected into  ced-10(n1993); sli-1(sy143)  animals at a concentration of 20 ng/µl with a plasmid containing  myo-2::rfp  as a coinjection marker at 5 ng/µl and with 35 ng/µl of 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder for a total concentration of 80 ng/µl per injection. The pharynges of transgenic animals were RFP-positive. For quantification of unengulfed apoptotic cell corpses, embryos were grown at 20°C, heat-shocked for one hour at 33°C, placed at 20°C for up to four hours after which cell corpses in the heads of newly hatched first larval stage (L1) animals were counted. For quantification of DTC migration defects, animals were heat shocked for one hour at 33°C and placed at 22°C for 30 hours. DTC morphology in young adults was then analyzed in an equal number of animals with and without the transgenic arrays. 200 gonad arms were analyzed per genotype. Two independent transgenic lines were analyzed for each transgene combination except for the engulfment analysis of P hsp sli-1ΔRING,  in which only one line was used. This was because only one of the lines produced viable L1 larvae after heat shock during embryogenesis. Attempts were made with five separate lines. We presume this line had lower expression levels based on the fact that high expression levels of SLI-1 proteins are toxic to worms. Also, the line that produced viable larvae had comparatively faint GFP staining."

    "SLI-1 probably acts in engulfing cells": {

Specifically, the number of cell corpses in the heads of newly hatched worms was counted within 300 minutes of heat shock. Since all apoptotic deaths in the heads occur prior to 300 minutes before hatching,  sli-1  could not be expressed in the dying cells.",
        "p1": "Expression of  sli-1  in  ced-10(n1993); sli-1(sy143)  animals increased the number of unengulfed corpses in L1 heads from 13.4 to 23.7 ( p <1×10 −4 ) (for comparison,  ced-10(n1993)  animals had 20.0 corpses ( Table 1 )), whereas expression of a  gfp -only control transgene did not increase the number of unengulfed corpses (17.3 vs. 16.4;  p >0.2) ( Table 3 ). Notably, in the  gfp -expressing animals, GFP was not seen in the cell corpses, in support of our hypothesis that the engulfed cell did not make new proteins (data not shown). Thus, expressing  sli-1  outside of the engulfed cell rescues the  sli-1  mutant phenotype, indicating that  sli-1  acts in the engulfing cell."

Three of them, the myotubularin lipid phosphatase MTM-1, the adapter SWAN-1 and the RacGAP SRGP-1, act through the CED-10 Rac pathway  [20] – [23] . It is unknown how the  C. elegans  progranulin, PGRN-1, suppresses engulfment defects  [24] . Genetic and biochemical data indicate that ABL-1 inhibits ABI-1 in parallel to the CED-10 Rac pathway  [14] .",
        "p1": "Since  abl-1  and  sli-1  both act independently of the  ced-10  Rac pathway, we asked whether  sli-1  and  abl-1  act in the same pathway. We generated triple mutant strains containing mutations in an engulfment gene and in  abl-1  and  sli-1  and compared the engulfment defects and DTC migration defects to those of double mutant strains containing mutations in engulfment genes and either  abl-1  or  sli-1 . We found that the engulfment defect of the null mutant  ced-1(e1735)  was suppressed to a greater degree by the combination of  abl-1(ok171)  and  sli-1(n3538)  than by either mutation alone ( Table 4 ). The same phenomenon was observed for the partial loss of function  ced-10(n1993)  allele. The engulfment defect of the null mutant  ced-5(n1812)  was not suppressed by the  abl-1  or  sli-1  mutations together or alone, consistent with our prior results that neither  sli-1  nor  abl-1  loss-of-function can suppress null defects in the  ced-10  Rac pathway. The  ced-6(n2095)  engulfment defect was suppressed by both the  abl-1(ok171)  and the  sli-1(n3538)  alleles, but they did not enhance each other. The  ced-6(n2095); sli-1(n3538)  strain had 10.2 unengulfed corpses while the  ced-6(n2095); abl-1(ok171) sli-1(n3538)  strain had 10.4 unengulfed corpses. While it is not clear why these mutations did not enhance each other in the  ced-6  mutant background, the suppression by  sli-1(n3538)  is very strong and we suspect that we are near the threshold of the sensitivity of the engulfment assay so that further enhancement cannot be detected despite independent effects on engulfment.",
        "p2": "For the DTC migration defect,  ced-5(n1812)  was suppressed by both  abl-1(ok171)  and  sli-1(n3538)  and was significantly more suppressed by the combination of the two mutations ( Figure 5 ). By contrast, the DTC migration defect of  ced-10(n1993)  was suppressed so effectively by  sli-1(n3538)  that the addition of the  abl-1(ok171)  mutation did not enhance the suppression, similar to what was observed in engulfment with the  ced-6(n2095)- containing strains. However, it appears that there is a trend towards increased suppression with  sli-1  and  abl-1  mutations together though the difference does not reach statistical significance ( Figure 5 ).",
        "p3": "abi-1  encodes the only  C. elegans  homolog of Abi, a member of the Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC). A combination of genetic and biochemical data suggest that ABL-1 and the CED-10 Rac pathway both act on the WRC through ABI-1 in parallel to each other: CED-10 Rac activates ABI-1 and ABL-1 inhibits it. Since SLI-1 acts in parallel to ABL-1, we asked whether it also acts on ABI-1. The only  abi-1  mutations in existence (and  abi-1  feeding RNAi) are quite weak and have no effect on engulfment alone but do enhance the engulfment defects of mutations in other engulfment genes. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of  abi-1  mutation in combination with another engulfment mutation. Specifically,  ced-1(e1735)  null mutant animals containing combinations of mutations of  abi-1  and/or  sli-1  were assessed for the magnitude of their engulfment defects.  sli-1(sy143)  suppressed the engulfment defect of  ced-1(e1735)  animals in the presence or absence of the  abi-1(tm494)  mutation ( Figure 6A ).  ced-1(e1735)  L1 animals had 25.3 unengulfed corpses and  ced-1(e1735); abi-1(tm494)  animals had 35.0 corpses.  ced-1(e1735); abi-1(tm494); sli-1(sy143)  animals had 30.1 corpses. Similar findings were found for  ced-5(n1812)  mutants ( Figure 6B ). We also tested the effect of  abi-1  on DTC migration using the  ced-5(n1812)  null mutation ( Figure 6C ). Similar to the findings with  ced-1  in engulfment,  sli-1(sy143)  suppressed the DTC migration defect of  ced-5(n1812)  (48% vs. 29%) and  sli-1(sy143)  suppressed the DTC migration defect of an  abi-1(tm494); ced-5(n1812)  double mutant (49% vs. 26%). Thus, mutation of  abi-1  did not completely suppress the effect of  sli-1  on engulfment or DTC migration.  abi-1(tm494)  abolishes the ability of  abl-1  null mutations to suppress defects in engulfment and DTC migration  [14] . While these results do not prove that  sli-1  acts in a different pathway from  abi-1 , the findings are in stark contrast to those for  abl-1,  since  abi-1  mutation does not abrogate the effects of a  sli-1  null mutation on engulfment and DTC migration. Thus,  abi-1  might act independently of the WRC.",

The  ced-5(n1812)  mutation totally inactivates the  ced-10  Rac pathway. If  sli-1  acted upstream of the  ced-10  Rac pathway, the  ced-5(n1812)  mutation would block the ability of  sli-1(sy143)  to suppress the  abi-1(tm494)  engulfment defect, which we did not observe."

Mammalian Ras activates Rac. Therefore, it was plausible that SLI-1 might inhibit engulfment by suppressing the LET-23/LET-60 pathway and consequently decreasing activation of CED-10 Rac by LET-60. To test this possibility, we generated strains doubly mutant for engulfment genes and the gain-of-function mutation  let-60(n1046gf) . We would expect gain-of-function mutations in this pathway to suppress engulfment defects if  sli-1  normally inhibits this pathway. We found no consistent effect on the number of unengulfed apoptotic cells in animals with or without the  let-60(n1046gf)  mutation ( Figure 7 ). One allele of  ced-12  was slightly enhanced while another allele of  ced-12  and an allele of  ced-2  were slightly suppressed. The only significantly modulated mutation was  ced-6(n2095) , which was suppressed. Possibly this effect reflects a gene- or allele-specific interaction with  let-60.  Regardless, this pattern does not phenocopy either  sli-1  mutation. Thus,  sli-1  does not appear to act through the  let-23  EGFR/ let-60  Ras pathway to inhibit engulfment."

The SLI-1 protein contains three domains, an N-terminal domain that binds tyrosine kinases (and several other proteins), a RING finger, which mediates its E3 ubiquitin ligase function and a C-terminal domain, which contains several proline-rich regions. Minigenes encoding wild-type  sli-1  and truncation mutants of  sli-1  lacking each of the three domains expressed under heat-shock promoter control were injected into  ced-10(n1993); sli-1(sy143)  worms. These constructs were generated previously  [30]  and generously provided to us by Paul Sternberg.  ced-10(n1993); sli-1(sy143)  larvae harboring extrachromosomal arrays were incubated for one hour at 33°C, and their gonadal morphologies were analyzed 30 hours later in young adults. The arrays contained  sli-1  minigenes encoding full-length  sli-1  or  sli-1  lacking the N-terminus, RING finger or C-terminus ( sli-1wt, sli-1ΔN, sli-1ΔRING  or  sli-1ΔC,  respectively).  Figure 8  shows that the  sli-1wt  construct rescued the defect completely, while  sli-1ΔRING  and  sli-1ΔC  both partially rescued the defect and the  sli-1ΔN  did not rescue the defect at all. We also tested the  sli-1ΔRING  transgene in engulfment and found that it partially rescued the engulfment suppression defect ( Table 3 ).",
        "p1": "Thus, the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain was strictly required for the function of  sli-1  in DTC migration, whereas the RING finger and C-terminus were at least partially dispensable, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity is unlikely to be central to the role of  sli-1  in DTC migration. Consistent with our findings in DTC migration, the RING finger was also partially dispensable in engulfment."

Our genetic analysis suggests that SLI-1 acts in a manner that does not require the known engulfment pathways. Ectopic expression experiments indicate that SLI-1 acts in engulfing cells and that its function is dependent on its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain. Interestingly, these experiments demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase function of SLI-1 is at least partially dispensable.",

In addition, in both mammals and worms, SLI-1 Cbl downregulates LET-23 EGFR by ubiquitination  [29] . These interactions provided the rationale for our study of SLI-1 in engulfment initially. However, we found that the effects of SLI-1 on engulfment were independent of all of these proteins (with the possible exception of ABI-1; we were unable to test an  abi-1  null mutant). This finding highlights the multiple roles signaling proteins play in the regulation of complex cell biological processes. Also, these data emphasize the value of genetic analyses in discerning the physiological relevance of physical interactions discovered  in vitro  for a particular process.",
        "p2": "Like many other genetic suppressors,  sli-1  mutation has no effect on normal engulfment. Specifically, only two engulfment suppressors,  srgp-1  and  pgrn-1,  have been shown to increase the rate of clearance of apoptotic cells in wild-type animals whereas  abl-1, swan-1  and  mtm-1  do not do so  [14] ,  [20] – [24] . Notably, the  srgp-1  and  pgrn-1  effects are subtle ones seen in early embryos. Possibly, the engulfment process is so efficient that derepressing it by removing inhibitors has little or no demonstrable effect. Similarly, only  srgp-1  and  mtm-1  cause engulfment defects when overexpressed. However, overexpression of a protein does not always result in increased activity; activation of the protein might be required, explaining the lack of overexpression phenotypes. In the case of  sli-1,  overexpression is toxic to worms so our ability to discern whether overexpression caused increased cell corpse accumulation was limited.",
        "p3": "The discovery of SLI-1 as an inhibitor of engulfment adds to the small list of engulfment inhibitory proteins. Moreover, our genetic analysis puts SLI-1 into a new genetic pathway. Specifically,  sli-1  loss-of-function mutations suppress the engulfment defects of  ced-1  pathway null mutations and the DTC migration defects of  ced-10  Rac pathway null mutations. Thus, SLI-1 could act in a molecular pathway in parallel to both the  ced-1  and  ced-10  Rac pathways or it might act downstream of one or both pathways. However, the  ced-1  pathway has no role in DTC migration, so it is unlikely that  sli-1  acts downstream of the  ced-1  pathway given its effect on that process. Also,  sli-1  loss-of-function mutations do not suppress the engulfment defects of  ced-10  Rac pathway null mutations and therefore cannot be downstream of the  ced-10  Rac pathway. Thus, the simplest model consistent with the data is that  sli-1  acts in parallel to both  ced-10  Rac and  ced-1  pathways.",
        "p4": "abl-1,  another inhibitor of engulfment and DTC migration defects, has a very similar pattern of interactions with the two core engulfment pathways, demonstrating that it, too, acts in parallel to the  ced-1  and  ced-10  Rac pathways. We show that  abl-1  and  sli-1  act in parallel to each other in these processes as well. Thus, SLI-1 defines a new pathway of inhibition of engulfment and DTC migration.",
        "p5": "The genetic interactions between  abl-1  and  abi-1  and  sli-1  and  abi-1  differ considerably. Whereas even very weak loss-of-function of  abi-1  completely suppresses the effects of  abl-1  mutations on engulfment and DTC migration, the same  abi-1  mutation only minimally suppresses the effect of  sli-1  on these processes. These findings are consistent with a model in which  sli-1  acts independently of the Wave Regulatory Complex in engulfment and DTC migration though we cannot conclude that since  abi-1  null mutants were not used in the analysis.",
        "p6": "Most of our understanding of the function of SLI-1 comes from mammalian studies of its homolog c-Cbl in cell culture. These studies have demonstrated a large number of protein-protein interactions. To discover which of these interactions might be relevant to the engulfment inhibitory function of  sli-1,  we tested which domains were required to rescue SLI-1 function. The only essential domain was the N-terminal TKB domain. While our studies do not preclude a role for the C-terminal proline-rich or RING finger domains, they do indicate that these domains are not central to the engulfment and cell migration functions of SLI-1.",
        "p7": "The TKB domain includes three motifs: a four helix bundle, a Ca ++  binding EF hand and an SH2 domain. These three motifs together define a unique domain that binds phosphotyrosines of protein tyrosine kinases  [26] . This binding, in turn, allows the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of the RING finger of Cbl to ubiquitinate and target these tyrosine kinases for destruction or sequestration. However, since the RING finger domain, which is required for ubiquitination, is partially dispensable for inhibition of cell migration by SLI-1, the above mechanism cannot explain our results.",
        "p8": "In addition to tyrosine kinases, several other proteins have been shown to interact with the N-terminal TKB domain. One of them is APS, an adapter protein that is involved in insulin signaling  [47] . However there is no obvious APS homolog in  C. elegans . Furthermore, APS signaling requires the C-terminus of Cbl in mammals and the phenotypes we describe only partially require the C-terminal domain. Another interactor, SLAP, the Src-like adapter protein, also binds to the N-terminus of Cbl  [48] . It, too, has no obvious homolog in  C. elegans .",
        "p9": "A third TKB domain interactor is tubulin. Alpha and beta tubulin bind to the Cbl N-terminus  [49] ,  [50] , and Cbl co-purifies with tubulin in B-cell lysates  [51] . The idea that an interaction between SLI-1 and tubulin is involved in engulfment suppression is intriguing for several reasons. First, it would support a role for microtubules in apoptotic cell engulfment, which until now has been shown to be regulated solely by actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. Second, it would fit with our genetic findings concerning  sli-1 . Specifically,  sli-1  inhibits both engulfment and DTC migration, two processes totally dependent on appropriate cytoskeletal regulation. Third,  sli-1  appears to act in parallel to all known engulfment genes and engulfment inhibitors. That, too, would be consistent with  sli-1  action affecting an entirely different molecular pathway, namely one regulating microtubules.",
        "p10": "The discovery that  sli-1  acts through a pathway in parallel to the two core engulfment pathways ( ced-10  Rac and  ced-1 ) suggests that there are still other cell biological processes involved in apoptotic cell engulfment yet to be discovered. Since the two core pathways were discovered over 20 years ago, it begs the question of why these processes were not identified previously. Possibly, defects in the unidentified processes result in embryonic lethality so they were not identified in genetic screens. Alternatively, these pathways are redundant with the core pathways and, therefore, would only be discovered in the absence of one or both of them. Regardless of the answer, the existence of other pathways suggests that very tight control of engulfment is required during development.",
        "p11": "Much of the work on engulfment has been aimed at identifying which signals from the dying cell activate the  ced-10  Rac and  ced-1  pathways. Our findings suggest that in addition to the need for positive signals, engulfing cells require multiple inhibitory signals to prevent inappropriate engulfment. As discussed earlier, engulfment of dying cells promotes their programmed cell deaths. Potentially there are circumstances during development when cells are particularly susceptible to engulfment-mediated death, which, unless prevented, would result in excess cell death and developmental errors. Perhaps these inhibitory pathways exist as a failsafe mechanism to prevent such errors."

The resulting plasmid contained the 5 kb upstream of M02A10.3a adjacent to  gfp  (GFP[S65C]). The plasmid was injected into gonads of N2 animals with the coinjection marker P unc-122 ::rfp  (50 ng/µl for each with 50 ng/µl 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Invitrogen) to a total concentration 150 ng/µl). Three independent transgenic lines were observed and photographed using fluorescence and DIC microscopy. For the translational GFP fusion, we used  in vivo  recombination ( http://wormbook.org/chapters/www_reportergenefusions/reportergenefusions.html ). Fosmid WRM0611cB12 was digested with MscI and SpeI, generating a 9 kb fragment which includes 5 kb of sequence upstream of M02A10.3a and 4 kb of the M02A10.3a sequence. To make the second fragment, a 5 kb full length M02A10.3a sequence was PCR amplified from fosmid WRM0611cB12 and then inserted into vector pDEST-MB14 using the Gateway method (Invitrogen), resulting in an in-frame fusion of M02A10.3a with GFP at its C-terminus. Then this plasmid was cut with PstI and SacII, making a 6 kb fragment including the C-terminal 4.5 kb of M02A10.3a fused with  gfp  and some additional sequence from pDEST-MB14. The 2 fragments were mixed with the co-injection marker P myo-2 ::rfp  (50 ng/µl for each with 50 ng/µl 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder to a total concentration 200 ng/µl) and injected into the gonads of  ced-10(n1993);sli-1(sy143)  animals.
