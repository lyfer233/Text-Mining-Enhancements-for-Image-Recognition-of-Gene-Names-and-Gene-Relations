    "Figure 6": "The activation of IκB-α and NF-κB could upregulate MMP-9 production in  A. cantonensis -induced leukocytes. Blocking IκB-α and NF-κB signaling by MG132 could reduce MMP-9 production. Further, blocking MMP-9 activity by GM6001 could reduce claudin-5 degradation and blood-CSF barrier permeability during angiostrongyliasis meningoencephalitis. Therefore, we suggest that MMP-9 could cause claudin-5 degradation and promote leukocyte infiltration into CSF by the paracellular route during  A. cantonensis  infection in mouse choroid plexus."
