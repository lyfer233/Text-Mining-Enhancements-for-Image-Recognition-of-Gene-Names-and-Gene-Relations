    "fig 1A": "The effects of ChPL on MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation were determined with the use of the MTT assay over a period over 24 to 72 h. The IC 50 value of ChPL after 24 h was 1.2 and 3.7 µM for MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. After a further 24 h of incubation, the IC 50 values decreased to 0.6 and 2 µM, for MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. The IC 50 values for ChPL did not decrease significantly with further incubation ( Figure 1A ). Further analysis was performed to compare the anti-proliferative activity of plumbagin and its 3-chloro-derviative. The effects of ChPL and PL on the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells were analyzed after a 72-h incubation. Data analysis revealed that after this period, the IC 50 value of plumbagin was comparable to that of ChPL ( Figure 1B ). The IC 50 values for MDA-MB-468 cells were 0.6 and 0.4 µM for ChPL and PL, respectively, and 2 and 1.8 µM for ChPL and PL for MCF7 cells, respectively. Furthermore, the anti-proliferative activity of both compounds was analyzed toward a control, immortalized breast epithelial cell line, MCF 10A. ChPL displayed significantly lower cytotoxicity toward MCF 10A cells than PL. At the highest examined concentration of 10 µM, plumbagin decreased cell viability by 46% after a 72-h incubation period, whereas at this time point, the viability of ChPL-treated cells was 82% ( Figure 1B ).",

    "fig 1": "Since naphthoquinones have previously been reported to induce apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated pathway, the involvement of the Bcl-2 family proteins in ChPL-induced cell death was further examined. MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells were treated for 24 h with ChPL, and the levels of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins were determined with Western blot analysis. The results showed that the levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 decreased upon ChPL treatment in both cell lines. A significant decrease in Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 levels was observed in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells at the lowest concentrations tested. Furthermore, ChPL increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells. In accordance with the results of the anti-apoptotic proteins, the lowest examined concentrations of ChPL significantly increased pro-apoptotic protein levels ( Figure 3 , Supplementary Figure 1 ). The activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins leads to the permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane and the subsequent release of cytochrome c ; thus, the effects of ChPL on cytochrome c release were examined. Western blot analysis revealed an increase in cytochrome c levels in the cytosol of MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells upon treatment with ChPL. Cytochrome c increase in the cytosol was accompanied by a decrease of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial fraction of cells ( Figure 3 , Supplementary Figure 2 ).Taken together, these data indicate that ChPL induces apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated pathway.

MDA-MB-468 cells, which were more sensitive to ChPL treatment, were treated with combination doses of ChPL and PTX in the dose range of 0.1 to 2 µM (ChPL) and 0.1 to 20 nM (PTX). As shown in Figure 1C , combination treatment with ChPL and PTX significantly reduced cell viability in comparison to single agent treatments.

    "fig 2A": "To determine the mode of cell death induced by ChPL in breast cancer cells, characteristic features of apoptotic cell death were examined. Phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase induction were determined in ChPL-treated MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells.

Similarly to the results of cell viability determination, the MDA-MB-468 cells were more sensitive to ChPL-induced cell death. At the concentration of 1 µM, a 25% increase in caspase activation was observed and at 5 µM, caspase induction increased by around 55%. In the case of MCF-7 cells, a 13% and 30% increase in caspase activity induction was observed at the ChPL concentration of 1 µM and 5 µM, respectively ( Figure 2A ). In accordance with caspase induction, ChPL also induced phosphatidylserine externalization in breast cancer cells, as analyzed by Annexin V staining. Cytometric analysis of MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells treated with ChPL for a period of 24 h revealed cells mainly in the late-apoptotic stage. At the concentrations of 1 and 5 µM, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased by 30% and 60% in MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively, whereas in MCF-7 cells at these concentrations, a 10% and 40% increase in apoptotic cell populations were observed ( Figure 2B ).",

To determine the effects of ChPL on MAPK signaling in breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells were treated with ChPL and Western blot analysis was performed to examine the effects of ChPL on levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK in breast cancer cells. Cells were pretreated for 24 h with plumbagin after which the levels of p-ERK and p-MEK were stimulated with EGF for 30 min. The results of Western blot analysis revealed that ChPL reduces the levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK, induced by EGF ( Figure 4A , Supplementary Figure 3 and 4 ). The results obtained with Western blot analysis were confirmed with quantitative AlphaScreen assay analysis of the influence of ChPL on p-ERK inhibition. The AlphaScreen assay is a proximity-based assay employing streptavidin-coated beads conjugated with a biotinylated peptide substrate and acceptor beads with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Provided that the phosphorylation of the ERK protein occurs, the beads are brought into proximity through the binding of the phosphospecific antibody on the acceptor bead. The excitation of donor beads induces the release of singlet oxygen molecules that triggers a cascade of energy transfer in the acceptor beads that results in light emission. To determine the effects of ChPL on p-ERK inhibition, cells were pretreated for 1 h with ChPL after which p-ERK was induced with EGF for 30 min. As demonstrated in Figure 4B , the relative levels of endogenous phosphorylated ERK at residues Thr202 and Tyr 204 were induced with EGF stimulation in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells. The treatment of cells with ChPL markedly reduced the levels of EGF-induced p-ERK, and at the concentrations of 0.2 µM and 1 µM a significant reduction in the levels p-ERK were detected in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells, respectively ( Figure 4B ). Further experiments were conducted to evaluate the ability of ChPL to synergistically interact with an EGF inhibitor (AG1478) to inhibit MAPK/ERK signaling in breast cancer cells. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with ChPL and/or AG1478, after which p-ERK was induced with EGF for 30 min. The results of the Alpha Screen assay showed a significant reduction in p-ERK in cells pre-treated with a combination of ChPL and AG1478 in comparison to cells treated with single agents ( Figure 4C ). Collectively, these results point to the ability of ChPL to inhibit MAP kinase signaling in breast cancer cells.",

    "fig 6": "The results of the research presented herein show that ChPL induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through MAP kinase signaling inhibition and activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway involving Mcl-1 downregulation ( Figure 6 ). The activity of ChPL was comparable to that of its precursor, plumbagin. PL is an extensively researched naphthoquinone with promising anti-cancer potential. Plumbagin has been reported to selectively inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells and suppress breast tumor xenograft growth in mice ( Kuo et al., 2006 ). In the present research, ChPL displayed similar activity toward breast cancer cells as plumbagin. The therapeutic potential of ChPL can be emphasized by the lower cytotoxicity of ChPL toward non-tumorigenic, epithelial MCF 10A cells in comparison to plumbagin. Furthermore, in the presented research, ChPL displayed higher activity toward triple negative breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-468, which is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. Since the expression of MCL-1 in triple negative breast cancer is high, the ability of ChPL to decrease Mcl-1 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells points to its promising potential in breast cancer treatment. Moreover, ChPL inhibited both the Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 arm of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, which is important in minimizing drug resistance occurrence. These findings encourage further investigation into the anticancer potential of ChPL, specifically toward breast cancer cells. The involvement of MAPK signaling inhibition in ChPL-mediated apoptosis induction was examined by silencing the expression of ERK in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells and determining the potential of ChPL to induce apoptosis in these cells.
