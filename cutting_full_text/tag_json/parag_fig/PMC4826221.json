DU145 cells were stimulated with GL and the expression kinetic of the indicated proteins was analyzed. As shown in Figure 5A , the protein levels of pCDC25C (Ser216), CDC25C and pWee1 (Ser642) were clearly down-regulated in a time-dependent manner in response to GL treatment. By contrast, other proteins such as Cyclin B1, pHistone H3 (Ser10) or p21 were up-regulated. No significant change was observed in pCDK1 (Tyr15) and Myt1 expression levels, while Myt1 hyperphosphorylation was clearly detected after 12 h of treatment.

To study this possibility, we first monitored CHK1 and CHK2 activation levels by analyzing the phosphorylation at Ser345 and Thr68, respectively. We show in Figure 5B that GL treatment led to CHK1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, not affecting the phosphorylation levels of CHK2.

By contrast, a significant reduction of the volume tumor was observed during the treatment (Figure 8B ) and the tumor weight was also significantly decreased after 21 days of GL treatment in comparison with untreated group (Figure 8C ). To investigate activation of DDR signaling pathway caused by GL we determined the expression of phosphorylated H2AX. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue sections showed that γH2AX positive cells expression was significantly higher in mice treated with GL in comparison with untreated mice (Figure 8D ). These results confirm that activation of DNA damage signaling occurs in vitro and also in vivo .",
    "fig 8": "Previous studies have demonstrated that GL produces a decrease tumor growth in several animal models of prostate cancer [ 20 , 22 ]. Therefore, next we were interested in studying DDR after GL treatment in vivo . DU145 cell xenograft mouse model received a dose of 3 mg/kg through i.p injections every day for 21 days. Our results demonstrated that GL did not affect body weight of mice (Figure 8A ). By contrast, a significant reduction of the volume tumor was observed during the treatment (Figure 8B ) and the tumor weight was also significantly decreased after 21 days of GL treatment in comparison with untreated group (Figure 8C ).

    "fig 9": "It has been previously shown that GL is a dual NF-κB /STAT3 inhibitor, but nothing is known about its effects on cell cycle and DDR signaling in cancer cells. In this study, our results demonstrate that GL was able to induce cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M phase in human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC3), with similar results in other cancer cell lines like Jurkat and SK-N-SH (data not shown). Similarly, GL induces apoptosis in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells through activation of ATM/ATR-CHK1 signaling without inducing DNA break. Thus, GL may exert antitumoral activity at different levels: inhibiting the action of the pro-survival transcription factors STAT3/NF-κB, inducing DNA damage signaling pathway and inhibiting DNA repairing mechanism (Figure 9 ). However, further studies are required to confirm that G 2 /M cell cycle arrest and activation of ATM/ATR-signaling depend on these transcription factors. In summary, this study reports for the first time a new mechanism of action for GL, with important consequences on the damage response pathway in the context of its antitumor activities on prostate cancer. We demonstrate how fungal GL induces DDR via ATM/ATR-CHK1 pathway, causing apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer (Figure 9 ), inhibiting tumor growth in vivo in mouse tumor models. These findings validate GL as a promising antitumor agent for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer, alone or in combination with other drugs."
