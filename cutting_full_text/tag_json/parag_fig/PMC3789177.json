    "fig 1c": "We reasoned that the increased number of apoptotic cells in the dlc-1(RNAi) animals could be because of excessive germ cells undergoing apoptosis or an engulfment defect preventing their removal. The CED-1::GFP marker can only be used if proper internalisation of the dead cells is taking place during the engulfment process; consequently, the CED-1::GFP marker does not detect apoptotic cells in the engulfment-defective mutants ced-5 and ced-6 . 39 We confirmed that persistent cell corpses observable with DIC in ced-5(tm1950) and ced-6(tm1826) mutants could not be seen with the CED-1::GFP marker ( Figure 1c ). Therefore, as the apoptotic cells in dlc-1(RNAi) animals could be observed equally well with DIC and CED-1::GFP, RNAi against dlc-1 did not result in an engulfment defect. Thus, dlc-1(RNAi) animals do not phenocopy engulfment-defective mutants.",
    "fig 1d": "To investigate whether dlc-1 is also involved in somatic apoptosis during development, we analysed L1 larvae for the presence of persistent cell corpses in the head with DIC microscopy. Wild-type N2 larvae have no visible cell corpses, whereas engulfment mutants, such as ced-5(tm1950) and ced-6(tm1826) , have many persistent cell corpses 18 (and Figure 1d ). Inactivation of dlc-1 in wild-type N2 worms did not result in persistent cell corpses, indicating that dlc-1 does not affect engulfment during development. Increased apoptosis during development can be seen in engulfment-defective mutant backgrounds, as the extra dead cells are not as efficiently removed as in wild-type worms. However, RNAi against dlc-1 had no effect on the number of corpses observed in ced-5 or ced-6 mutants ( Figure 1d ). This suggests that RNAi against dlc-1 does not affect somatic cell death or engulfment but specifically increases germ cell apoptosis.",

We speculated whether the observed apoptotic phenotype was specific for the inactivation of dlc-1 or whether it was a general phenotype for all the dynein light chains. Following their inactivation, none of the other five light chains resulted in an increased number of apoptotic germ cells ( Figure 1e ). Furthermore, we also investigated the effect on apoptosis after knockdown of the main dynein heavy chain, dhc-1. As RNAi against dhc-1 causes developmental arrest, we treated N2 wild-type worms with RNAi against dhc-1 from the L4 stage and scored apoptosis 48 h later using DIC, but no effect on germ cell apoptosis was observed ( Figure 1f ).

    "fig 6": "We have identified DLC-1 as a new gene required for proper apoptotic signalling between somatic cells and germ cells in response to IR acting through KRI-1. Our study is thus adding to the knowledge of the recently described KRI-1-mediated response to IR. Firstly, we find that KRI-1 is required for CED-3-dependent apoptosis induced by RNAi against dlc-1 . Secondly, our data show that DLC-1 regulates the level of KRI-1. Thirdly, we show that the DLC-1/KRI-1 signalling pathway operates via EGL-1 and CED-13. Based upon these results we propose a model in which DLC-1 is part of the response to IR-induced apoptosis through a cell-nonautonomous pathway depending on kri-1 and independent of cep-1 ( Figure 6 ). Consistent with this model we found that IR did not induce additional apoptosis in dlc-1(RNAi) animals. Our results strongly support that intercellular communication between somatic cells and germ cells is required for proper regulation of the cell-killing process. The clear involvement of DLC-1 in somatic tissues in regulating germ cell apoptosis led us to investigate a possible involvement of kri-1 . The KRI-1 ankyrin-repeat protein is orthologous to the human KRIT1/CCM1, and it is required for IR-induced apoptosis in a novel pathway acting in somatic cells. 16 We examined the epistatic relationship between dlc-1 and kri-1 by treating kri-1(ok1251) mutants with RNAi against dlc-1 . kri-1 mutants fed dlc-1 RNAi had significantly fewer apoptotic germ cells than wild-type N2 animals treated with RNAi against dlc-1 ( Figure 5c ).

The marker was first crossed to MD701, and F2s were selected by their Unc phenotype and GFP expression. This strain was then crossed to ced-3, and F2s were selected for GFP expression and non-Unc phenotypes. To validate the cep-1 mutant, we used IR to introduce DNA damage-induced apoptosis. As expected, the cep-1 mutant had no apoptotic cells in the germline after IR ( Supplementary Figure S10 )."
