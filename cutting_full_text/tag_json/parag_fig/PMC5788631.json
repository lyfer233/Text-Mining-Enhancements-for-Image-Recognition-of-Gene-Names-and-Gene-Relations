Interestingly, the expression of YAP at various sites was different, including the outer AF, the inner AF, the NP, and the CE (Figure 5 ). The expression of YAP in the CE was consistent with that in the NP, and was gradually reduced with increasing age. As for YAP could regulate cell growth and maintain homeostasis, Hippo signaling was suppressed in rats at 4 weeks post-operatively but gradually increased with age, while YAP expression was consistent with natural IDD on MRI, H&E staining, and collagen type 2 staining.",
