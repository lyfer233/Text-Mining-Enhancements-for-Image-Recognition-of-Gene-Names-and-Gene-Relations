To verify the aforementioned in vitro pathway (stearic acid/LDH-a/cytokines) in vivo , we treated the HFD-feeding mice with inhibitors of TLR4 (see Supplementary Fig. S3b ), LDH-a or HIF1α (see Supplementary Fig. S3c ) and observed cytokine production in mouse cartilage. The HFD-feeding stimulated mRNA expression of IL-6 ( Fig. 6e ), TNF-α ( Fig. 6f ) and IL-1β ( Fig. 6g ), and this effect was partly attenuated by a single treatment of TLR4, LDH-a or HIF1α inhibitors ( Fig. 6e~g ). Simultaneous administration with TLR4 and LDH-a inhibitors fully prevented HFD-feeding-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in mouse cartilage ( Fig. 6e~g ). It should be noted that the HFD-feeding-stimulated VEGF expression was prevented by LDH-a or HIF1α inhibitors, but not by TLR4 inhibitor ( Fig. 6h ). These results verified that stearic acid/LDH-a/HIF1α was a TLR4-independent novel pathway in chondrocytes.",
    "fig 7a": "Aforementioned results revealed that lactate/HIF1α pathway was involved in saturated free fatty acid-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF. To further correlate this mechanism to physiological condition, we investigated the levels of plasma lactate, cartilage HIF1α and cytokines in age-matched female human donors with OA. Results revealed that production of plasma lactate ( Fig. 7a ), cartilage HIF1α ( Fig. 7b ), IL-6 ( Fig. 7c ), TNF-α ( Fig. 7d ), IL-1β ( Fig. 7e ) and VEGF ( Fig. 7f ) were positively correlated with the BMI in human donors.",

    "fig 8": "In all, we identified that elevated circulatory metabolite stearic acid increased lactate levels in the plasma and chondrocytes in a LDH-a-dependent manner. The stearic acid stimulated VEGF and proinflammatory cytokine production through a canonic TLR4 pathway and a novel lactate/HIF1α pathway ( Fig. 8 ). The molecules in both pathways might be potential diagnostic markers and functional therapeutic targets."
