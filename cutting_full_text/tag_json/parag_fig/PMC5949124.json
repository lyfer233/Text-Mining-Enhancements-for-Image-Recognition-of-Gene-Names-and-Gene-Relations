    "fig 1": "The Hh signaling pathway is important in embryonic development, differentiation, proliferation, and maintenance of some adult tissues. Ligands of this pathway in mammals include Sonic, Indian, and Desert. In the absence of these ligands, the transmembrane receptor ptch inhibits another transmembrane protein (smoothened [SMO]), resulting in deactivation of Hh pathway. By binding ligands to the ptch receptor, the inhibitory effect of patch is eliminated from SMO, and SMO activates the downstream transcription factors, including GLI (GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3) proteins. Then GLI translocates to the nucleus and activates Hh-related target genes[ 10 ] ( Fig. 1 ).",
    "fig 2": "The Hippo signaling pathway is a key element in cell growth and organ size, as well as in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tissues. Moreover, dysregulation of Hippo pathway is associated with initiation, development, and distant metastasis of GC[ 35 ]. The main components of this pathway are MST1/2, LATS1/2, Mob1, YAP1, and TAZ1. MST1/2 phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 and Mob1. Then LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP1 and TAZ and increases 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated YAP1/TAZ, leading to the oncogenic accumulation of the YAP1/TAZ in the cytoplasm. The unphosphorylated YAP1/TAZ translocates to the nucleus and binds to the TEAD1-4 transcription factors to induce transcriptional activity for cell growth and differentiation[ 36 ] ( Fig. 2 )."
