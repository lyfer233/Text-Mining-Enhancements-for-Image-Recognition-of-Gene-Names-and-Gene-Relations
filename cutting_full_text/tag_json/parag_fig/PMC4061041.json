We also noted a dramatic increase in pre-mature (∼60 kDa psCLU) and mature (∼40 kDa sCLU) forms of clusterin (a.k.a. apolipoprotein J) protein during senescence ( Figure 1C ); mature sCLU is ∼80 kDa formed by dimerization of two ∼30 kDa α and β sCLU peptides that are heavily glycosylated, but appear as ∼40 kDa forms under SDS reducing conditions.

Prior research from our laboratory demonstrated that sCLU induction in response to DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation (IR), occurred through IGF-1 production, stimulating IGF-1R/MAPK/Erk-1/2 signaling, culminating in activated Egr-1 that transcriptionally regulated sCLU expression [28] . We previously demonstrated that such responses were mediated by ATM activation, and not through ATR [27] . Since both RS and SIPS activate ATM via cellular DNA damage responses (DDR), we treated young (P13, PD#17), middle-aged (P18, PD#36) and senescent (P21, PD#92) IMR-90 cells with IR, then examined sCLU expression. sCLU levels were dramatically increased in young cells in response to IR treatment, while no additionally increases in sCLU levels were noted in irradiated senescent IMR-90 cells, which expressed extremely elevated basal levels of this pro-survival protein compared to young IMR-90 cells ( Figure 2F ). These results indicated that senescence-induced sCLU might employ the same signaling pathway as DDR-induced sCLU [27] . Consistent with this pathway, we noted that Erk-1 was activated (increased p-Erk-1/t-Erk) during senescence ( Figures 2E and 2F ), and activation of Erk-1 was further induced after IR treatment in young (Y) or middle-aged (M) IMR-90 cells. In contrast, IR exposure of senescent (S) IMR-90 cells caused no further Erk-1 activation ( Figure 2F ).

    "fig 3A": "ATM plays a central role in DDRs, as well as cellular senescence through RS or SIPS, to signal downstream effectors controlling survival and cell death [10] . To test whether ATM regulated sCLU expression during cellular senescence, we aged human diploid Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patient (AT2052) fibroblasts that lack functional ATM expression. AT2052 cells expressed significantly lower basal level expression of sCLU compared to wild-type ATM+ IMR-90 cells. These data are consistent with prior data from our lab, where ATM controlled IGF-1-sCLU expression after DNA damaging agents, and low basal levels of sCLU noted in AT cells were noted as resulting from detectable IGF-1 in the growth medium [27] . As expected, sCLU was not induced in senescent AT2052 versus IMR-90 cells ( Figure 3A ). Furthermore, AT cells were capable of inducing sCLU, since exposure of AT2052 cells with IGF-1 resulted in significant sCLU expression in 24 h compared to untreated control cells, and sCLU levels remain elevated 72 h after IGF-1 exposure ( Figure 3B ). Accordingly, activated Erk (increased P-Erk/t-Erk) was concomitantly noted 24 h after IGF-1 treatment ( Figure 3B ). These results indicated that signaling from IGF-1/IGF-1R to sCLU was still intact in ATM-deficient AT2052 cells. To further confirm this finding, another AT cell line (GM03487) was treated with IGF-1, and similarly, sCLU expression was increased in GM03487 cells 24 h post-treatment ( Figure 3B ). Similar results were also observed using a pair of immortalized AT cells lacking or reconstituted with ATM ( Figure 3C ), as demonstrated in Goetz et al., [27] . Collectively, these data are consistent with an ATM-mediated, IGF-1-regulated sCLU expression pathway that signals through the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)/MAPK/Erk-1/2/Egr-1 signaling pathway. The low level of constitutive sCLU expression, and lack of induction of sCLU during senescence in AT cells is due to the lack of functional ATM and not due to signaling from IGF-1/IGF-1R to sCLU expression. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that ATM controls IGF-1 expression during senescence, as it does after DDRs [27] . Our results demonstrate that sCLU protects cells from senescence, suggesting that a role of increased sCLU expression in senescent cells is to counteract senescence by some as yet known mechanism. This result is consistent with the role of ATM in protecting cells from senescence. AT fibroblasts expressed low basal levels of sCLU, and failed to induce sCLU during senescence or DDR responses, due to the lack of ATM signaling ( Figure 3A ) that controls IGF-1 production [27] . Thus, the role of sCLU expression in DDR responses mirrors ATM, as both AT cells and cells knocked down for sCLU expression are hypersensitive to oxidative stress and senescence. AT patients also age faster [38] , [39] , [40] , and patients with lowered circulatory sCLU levels also age less well than Centenarians in a recent study [36] . Re-introduction of ATM into AT cells increased the lifespan of AT cells and restored sCLU induction responses after DDR or senescence induction pathways [27] . Collectively, these results suggest that sCLU may play a role(s) in aging. Furthermore, increased levels of sCLU may protect cells from senescence ( Figure 6 ).",

We further analyzed IGF-1 levels in the medium and found that inhibition of ATM significantly decreased IGF-1 expression in these cells ( Figure 3E ).

Src and Erk-1/2 kinase levels were also elevated in middle-aged and senescent compared to young IMR-90 cells.

To further confirm the specificity of IGF-1/IGF-1R/MAPK/ERK-1/2/Egr-1 signaling in sCLU induction during senescence, we treated senescent IMR-90 cells with the IGF-1R inhibitor, AG1024, which effectively blocked IR-induced sCLU expression [27] , [28] and also suppressed sCLU expression in senescent IMR-90 cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 4C ). While significantly suppressing sCLU expression, we also noted that senescent IMR-90 cells exposed to the IGF-1R inhibitor (AG1024) underwent significant programmed cell death (apoptotic) responses in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 4C ).

The potential significance of these differential responses clinically could well depend on the age of a patient. Since senescence is probably tumor-suppressive in young individuals, but potentially tumor-promoting in aged individuals, efficacious adjuvant treatment of patients using sCLU knockdown therapies (using OGX011), or exposure to IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors, may well depend on the overall age of the individual. In the future, physicians may well decide to use OGX-011 in a young patient to promote the tumor-suppressive properties of this therapy to cause onset (and possibly increased overall numbers) of senescence cells. Then, later in life and if IGF-1R inhibitors are truly specific for senescent cells, the physician may subscribe such inhibitors for prevention of senescence-induced microenvironmental changes that might promote tumor survival and progression. Further mechanism studies and trials in young and aged mice in vivo will be required to explore these interesting senescence-induced micro-environmental dynamics.

Src and Erk-1/2 kinase levels were also elevated in middle-aged and senescent compared to young IMR-90 cells. The transcription factor, Egr-1, which binds the hCLU promoter and mediates sCLU expression [28] , was significantly increased during senescence in IMR-90 cells ( Figure 4B ). To further confirm the specificity of IGF-1/IGF-1R/MAPK/ERK-1/2/Egr-1 signaling in sCLU induction during senescence, we treated senescent IMR-90 cells with the IGF-1R inhibitor, AG1024, which effectively blocked IR-induced sCLU expression [27] , [28] and also suppressed sCLU expression in senescent IMR-90 cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 4C ). While significantly suppressing sCLU expression, we also noted that senescent IMR-90 cells exposed to the IGF-1R inhibitor (AG1024) underwent significant programmed cell death (apoptotic) responses in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 4C ). Interestingly, young and middle-aged cells did not respond to AG1024 in the same manner with no significant apoptosis noted after exposure to 5 µM of the drug ( Figure 4C ). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that when cell undergo RS or SIPS, but not oncogene-induced senescence, ATM-dependent DDR leads to increased IGF-1 expression that stimulates IGF-1R/MAPK/Erk-1/2/Egr-1 signaling that leads to concomitant elevated sCLU levels. The data further suggest that the IGF-1/IGF-1R-sCLU pathway is required for the overall survival of senescent cells, whereby suppressing this pathway induces an intracellular death decision. sCLU functions as an extracellular chaperone, protecting cells from inflammation, and suppressing apoptosis by its proposed interaction with Bax [22] , [33] . Its role in senescence has not been defined. Given the increased apoptotic responses in cells deficient of sCLU expression ( Figure 4C ) exposed to an IGF-1R inhibitor, we theorized that the effects of the IGF-1R inhibitor were due to the proposed apoptotic inhibitory effects of psCLU/sCLU. To explore sCLU’s role in senescence, we generated a conditionally inducible, doxycycline-regulated shRNA-sCLU knockdown lentiviral expression vector, pTRIPZ-shCLU. When infected into cells, pTRIPZ-shCLU controlled expression of shRNA specific to the intron I/Intron III junction found only in sCLU mRNA, and not in nuclear clusterin (nCLU) mRNA ( Figure 5E ); nCLU is a cytosolic form of clusterin that induces cell death when activated and translocated to the nucleus [35] , [36] . Early passage IMR-90 cells were first transduced with lentiviral pTRIPZ-shCLU, then selected with puromycin to generate a pooled population. pTRIPZ-shCLU-containing IMR-90 cells were then cultured with or without Dox, and population doublings (PDs) and %SA-β-gal+ cells monitored over time. Interestingly, Dox-treated, pTRIPZ-shCLU-containing IMR-90 cells with continuous sCLU knockdown showed decreased population doublings at ∼passage 20 ( Figure 5A ), suggesting that loss of sCLU expression enhanced SIPS responses in IMR-90 cells. Significant population doubling time differences were noted (p-value of two population doubling curves = 0.0001), with control cells plateauing at ∼40 days in culture, while Dox-treated IMR-90 cells underwent senescence at day 32 ( Figure 5A ). Enhanced senescence was confirmed by significant differences in the %SA-β-gal+ cells, where at least two-fold increases were noted compared to untreated pTRIPZ-shCLU IMR-90 cells that expressed sCLU at day 39 ( Figure 5B ). sCLU-shRNA knockdown was confirmed in Dox-exposed pTRIPZ-shCLU IMR-90 cells by Western blotting, while sCLU levels in cells similarly cultured without Dox were not affected and were significantly elevated ( Figure 5A ). To verify that these results were not affected by addition of Dox or lentiviral infection alone, we generated pooled clones using the same vector, but contain a non-targeting shRNA (pTRIPZ-non silencing). As shown in Figures 5C and 5D , Dox-inducible non-silencing shRNA had no affect on sCLU expression ( Figure 5C ), both population doubling times and %SA-β-gal+ cells were not significantly different with or without Dox exposure over the life of the IMR-90 cultures ( Figure 5C ). These results strongly suggested that decreased sCLU expression due specifically to shRNA-sCLU knockdown, facilitated senescence in IMR-90 cells. Thus, sCLU appears to play a protective role from senescence in IMR-90 cells. Interestingly, however, loss of sCLU did not lead to significant induction of apoptosis, strongly suggesting that the role of sCLU in senescence is to suspend the process and not to keep these cells alive. These data also strongly suggest that IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling, in contrast, is a major contributing factor that protects against programmed cell death induction in cells.",

    "fig 6": "Here, we show that sCLU is up-regulated at a transcription level during both RS and SIPS, but is not elevated in response to oncogene-induced senescence. This is consistent with prior findings in the literature showing that sCLU was induced in WI-38 cells during RS or after H 2 O 2 -induced SIPS [19] , [21] . Mechanistically, we also demonstrated that sCLU was induced during senescence through the ATM/IGF-1/IGF-1R/MAPK/Erk-1/2/Egr-1 signaling pathway, a pathway that is also stimulated and regulates sCLU induction during DDR ( Figure 6 ). These results support the observation that cellular senescence processes share significant overlap with DDR pathways. And many key factors (e.g., ATM, p53, p21) that are involved in the DDR in human cells also play important roles in cellular senescence responses. Our results demonstrate that sCLU protects cells from senescence, suggesting that a role of increased sCLU expression in senescent cells is to counteract senescence by some as yet known mechanism. This result is consistent with the role of ATM in protecting cells from senescence. AT fibroblasts expressed low basal levels of sCLU, and failed to induce sCLU during senescence or DDR responses, due to the lack of ATM signaling ( Figure 3A ) that controls IGF-1 production [27] . Thus, the role of sCLU expression in DDR responses mirrors ATM, as both AT cells and cells knocked down for sCLU expression are hypersensitive to oxidative stress and senescence. AT patients also age faster [38] , [39] , [40] , and patients with lowered circulatory sCLU levels also age less well than Centenarians in a recent study [36] . Re-introduction of ATM into AT cells increased the lifespan of AT cells and restored sCLU induction responses after DDR or senescence induction pathways [27] . Collectively, these results suggest that sCLU may play a role(s) in aging. Furthermore, increased levels of sCLU may protect cells from senescence ( Figure 6 ). Importantly, our data clearly support a role for ATM in the induction of sCLU levels in senescent cells by controlling IGF-1 expression. Upon DNA damage, including uncapped telomere ends of extensive DNA lesions created in SIPS responses, ATM is recruited to the damage site and activated via phosphorylation [34] . Activated ATM, in turn, stimulates several proteins that can mediate DNA damage repair, cause transient growth arrest, and possibly lead to cell death or senescence. Ironically, loss of ATM function sensitizes cells to DNA damage, leading to enhanced cell death and possibly senescence. ATM can be activated by naked telomeres and trigger cellular senescence signaling during RS [7] , [11] , [35] . Similarly, ATM activation by overwhelming DSB lesions may also lead to senescence signaling during SIPS. However, ATM also plays a protective role in aging and cellular senescence, since ATM-deficient AT cells undergo senescence faster [38] , [39] , [40] . Consistently, AT patients also age faster. Our finding that ATM up-regulates and controls the IGF-1-sCLU expression axis [27] , as well as sCLU protecting cells from senescence, may help to explain the role of ATM in senescence/aging protection ( Figure 6 ).",
    "fig 5": "Our original hypothesis was that as an anti-apoptotic protein, sCLU may increase the population doubling by protecting cells from spontaneous apoptosis. However, when sCLU was knocked down in middle-aged or senescent IMR-90 cells, we did not observe an increase in apoptosis in this cell population. These data suggest that the anti-apoptotic function of sCLU may somehow not be operative during senescence and may not contribute to increased cell growth. Surprisingly, Dox-induced shRNA-sCLU knockdown IMR-90 cells showed increased SA-β-gal+ stained cells, confirming its role in senescence protection ( Figure 5 ). sCLU also functions as an extracellular chaperone, that helps clear unfolded proteins from the surrounding microenvironment (conditioned medium). Several studies have shown that other chaperones, like heat shock proteins (HSPs), were involved in cellular senescence [37] , [38] , [39] , [40] , [41] . Decreasing or inhibiting Hsp90 or Hsp72 induced cellular senescence, while over-expression of Hsp72 suppressed senescence pathways [37] , [38] , [39] . A small heat shock protein, Hsp27, also suppressed senescence by modulating p53 signaling [40] . Thus, sCLU may protect cells from senescence by decreasing cellular stress caused by the accumulation of denatured proteins, since both the cellular level of HSPs and protein quality control declines during senescence [41] . Furthermore, other findings, as well as our results have shown that extracellular sCLU can interact with several cell surface receptors, such as IGF-1R, TGF-β receptor I and TGF-β receptor II, and its interactions with these receptors modulates their activities in as yet undefined mechanisms. Both IGF-1 and TGF-β receptor-mediated signaling pathways are involved in cellular senescence, thus sCLU might modulate (i.e., prevent) senescence by regulating the activities of these receptors. It should be noted that knocking down sCLU expression alone does not alter, or may enhance, IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling [27] ."
