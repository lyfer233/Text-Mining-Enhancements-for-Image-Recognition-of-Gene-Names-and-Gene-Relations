    "fig 1": "Cardiac fibrosis contributes to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although various therapeutic strategies have been developed to treat this condition, cardiac fibrosis is clinically variable, and the underlying mechanism is complex and remains intractable. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a major pathway in cardiac fibrosis and myocardial infarction (MI). The RAS consists of two counter-regulatory axes that control cardiovascular functions. The first axis consists of a series of enzymatic reactions culminating in the generation of angiotensin II (Ang II), which can result in angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-dependent MI and cardiac fibrosis by activation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-Ang II-AT1R axis 1 2 . The second axis is the ACE2-angiotensin(1-7) [Ang(1-7)]-Mas pathway that acts as a physiological antagonist of the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis. The balance of the ACE/ACE2 ratio and therefore the RAS ( Fig. 1 ) is critical for the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis and myocardial hypertrophy 3 .",
    "fig 2": "In the current study, we used an MI-induced rat model of cardiac fibrosis. The results showed that myocardial injury activated the AT1R/p38 MAPK pathway that disrupted the ACE/ACE2 ratio and further imbalanced the ACE-Ang II-AT1R and ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axes (including increases in ACE, Ang II, and AT1R, and decreases in ACE2, Ang(1-7), and Mas). Moreover, increasing Ang II and decreasing Ang(1-7) synergistically inhibited LXR-α expression. Consequently, the decrease of LXR-α further activated the AT1R/p38 MAPK pathway. This signalling created a positive feedback loop that amplified AT1R/p38 MAPK signalling, thereby disturbing the RAS balance and inducing cardiac fibrosis ( Fig. 2 ). Interestingly, pirfenidone (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2- [1 H]-pyridone, PFD) activated LXR-α expression, inhibited the AT1R/p38 MAPK pathway, and balanced the RAS in this rat model of cardiac fibrosis ( Fig. 2 ).",
    "fig 3B": "We used Masson’s trichrome staining to assess cardiac fibrosis and the infarct size. Cardiac fibrosis, especially interstitial fibrosis (collagen staining in blue), was significantly increased in MI hearts compared with sham animal hearts ( Fig. 3B ). PFD treatment substantially reduced these lesions ( Fig. 3C ), and losartan also ameliorated these pathological changes ( Fig. 3D ). Image and quantitative analyses indicated that the cardioprotective effects against cardiac fibrosis in losartan- and PFD-treated rats were consistent with a smaller infarct size (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01; Fig. 4 ). Moreover, the collagen volume fraction (CVF) in MI model, losartan, and PFD groups were 10.44 ± 3.04%, 5.44 ± 2.12% (P < 0.05), and 6.26 ± 2.07% (P < 0.05), respectively ( Fig. 5 ).

    "fig 9": "Because of the role of the AT1R/p38 MAPK pathway in cardiac fibrosis, we assessed the levels of AT1R and phospho-p38 MAPK. As shown in Fig. 9 , compared with the control group, the expression of AT1R and phospho-p38 MAPK was increased by 10.90 ± 1.12% and 10.33 ± 1.61% in the model group, respectively (P < 0.01). However, the AT1R blocker losartan notably inhibited this pathway, as shown by the decrease in AT1R and phospho-p38 MAPK expression (AT1R, 4.20 ± 1.05%; phospho-p38 MAPK, 5.12 ± 1.05%; all P < 0.01). PFD also normalised the expression of these two proteins compared with the model group (AT1R, 5.35 ± 1.07%; phospho-p38 MAPK, 3.49 ± 1.00%; all P < 0.01).",

In the present study, we measured the related proteins. As shown in Figs 9A and 10 , compared with the sham group, Ang II, ACE, and AT1R expression was markedly increased, and the expression of ACE2, Ang(1-7), and Mas was down-regulated (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). As expected, all of these changes were ameliorated by PFD administration. Additionally, losartan, an AT1R blocker, not only inhibited the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis but also activated the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis. These results showed that PFD treatment strongly influences RAS-related protein expression in MI-induced cardiac failure.",

    "fig 11": "Western blotting of proteins extracted from the left ventricular of rats revealed a substantial decrease in LXR-α after MI. However, LXR-α expression was significantly up-regulated compared with the MI model group after 4 weeks of PFD administration (P < 0.01, Fig. 11 ). Therefore, the protective effects of PFD could be due, in large part, to activation of LXR-α. Losartan also activated LXR-α expression in animal hearts during MI-induced cardiac fibrosis."
