First, we calculated the dose-inhibition response curve of carmustine on GSC proliferation. As shown in Figure 4A , carmustine inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 504.3 ± 25.3 μM for U87-GSCs and IC 50 of 395 ± 19.4 μM for primary-GSCs. We then treated GSCs with 200 μM carmustine to investigate whether chemoresistance was induced when cells were grown on different concentrations of FN.

Only primary-GSCs grown on 10 μg/mL FN showed restored cell viability (Figure 4B ; p < 0.01). Compared to cells grown on 10 μg/mL FN, cilengitide significantly decreased the cell viability of both U87-GSCs and primary-GSCs (Figure 4B ; p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Apoptosis determined by flow cytometry using annexin V–FITC + /PI − showed that growing U87-GSCs on 5 or 10 μg/mL FN significantly decreased the apoptosis induced by carmustine (Figure 4C ; p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). We also investigated cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) expression that is required for apoptosis-inducing factor translocation from mitochondria to the nucleus and that is cleaved at the onset of apoptosis by caspase 3. Compared to U87-GSCs grown without FN, higher levels of cleaved PARP expression were present in U87-GSCs grown without FN or grown on 1 μg/mL FN and treated with carmustine (Figures 4D,E ; p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, cilengitide reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of FN in the presence of carmustine to a slight degree at a concentration of 100 μM (Figures 4D,E ). For primary-GSCs, cilengitide alone induced higher expression of cleaved PARP ( p < 0.05). In accordance with U87-GSCs, higher levels of cleaved PARP expression were present in primary-GSCs grown without FN, or grown on 1 μg/mL FN and treated with carmustine (Figure 4D ; p < 0.05 for both). In comparison to U87-GSCs, when primary-GSCs were treated with carmustine and cilengitide, they showed significantly higher expression of cleaved PARP (Figures 4D,E ; p < 0.01). As a tumor suppressor gene, the intrinsic ability of p53 was to mediate apoptotic cell death and to cause cell cycle arrest. Its activity was determined by luciferase luminescence assays. As shown in Figure 4F , the p53 activity of U87-GSCs was elevated slightly without carmustine treatment in cells that grew in the absence of FN. However, p53 activity was markedly increased by carmustine to a peak value on day 1, but declined over the following 2 days (Figure 4F ). Compared to U87-GSCs grown in the absence of FN but with carmustine treatment, the p53 activity of U87-GCSs was suppressed markedly when grown on 5 or 10 μg/mL FN, respectively (Figure 4F ; p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 for 5 and 10 μg/mL FN, respectively, vs. 0 μg/mL FN).
