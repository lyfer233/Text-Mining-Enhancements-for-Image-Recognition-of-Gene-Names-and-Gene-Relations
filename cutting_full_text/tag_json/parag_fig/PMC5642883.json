To confirm whether these five nucleoproteins were involved in the expression of LCN2, the recombinant expression vectors and pGLB152 were transiently cotransfected into EC109 cells. The reporter activities for LCN2 expression were significantly increased ( Figure 2(a) ). This was also observed in EC109 cells stably expressing each of the five nucleoproteins upon cotransfection with pGLB152 ( Figure 2(b) ). Quantitation of LCN2 mRNA levels by real-time PCR showed a similar increase LCN2 mRNA levels by overexpression of each protein ( Figure 2(c) ). These results indicate that nucleoproteins MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXR β upregulate LCN2 gene expression at the transcription level and that LCN2 could be a target gene of these nucleoproteins.",

    "fig 3": "To explore which signal transduction pathways are activated in TPA-induced LCN2 transcription, EC109 cells were cotransfected with constructs pB152 and pRLTK. At 24 h following transfection, cells were first pretreated with the following kinase inhibitors, MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126 and PD98059), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), JNK inhibitor (SP600125), or PKC α / β inhibitor (myristoylated protein kinase C peptide inhibitor), and then induced by 5 ng/ml TPA for an additional 24 h, and the activity of the LCN2 promoter was assessed by luciferase reporter assays. The activity of the LCN2 promoter following TPA treatment was at least 12 times than that of the nontreated control. MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126 and PD98059) and JNK inhibitor (SP600125) significantly inhibited LCN2 reporter gene induction in a dose-dependent manner ( P < 0.01). MEK inhibitors was more effective than JNK inhibitor, with nearly 90% activity being inhibited by PD98059 at 60 μ M. The p38 MAPK inhibitor had no effect on LCN2 gene promoter activity at low concentrations (1 μ M or 5 μ M), but LCN2 promoter activity was inhibited by 40% ( P < 0.01) at concentrations up to 25 μ M. Nevertheless, PKC α / β kinase inhibitors showed no effect ( Figure 3 ). Next, we investigated which signaling pathways were activated during the TPA induction by analyzing LCN2 mRNA levels by real-time PCR following pretreatment of EC109 cells with MEK inhibitors for 1 h. LCN2 mRNA levels were decreased by more than 80% on average, compared with the TPA-induced group, close to the nontreated control ( P < 0.01) ( Figure 4 ).",

    "fig 5": "Following induction of EC109 cells with TPA, the level of p-ERK1/2, peaked at 12 h and then decreased by 24 h, but not ERK1/2, p-JNK, and p-38. This pattern was similar to TPA-induced LCN2 gene expression in EC109 cells ( Figure 5 ). Moreover, TPA-induced p-ERK1/2 levels could be blocked by MEK inhibitor U0126 in both a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner ( Figure 6 ). These findings suggest that transcription of the LCN2 gene is induced by TPA, and the increase of LCN2 gene promoter activity following TPA induction is mainly mediated by the MEK-ERK signal pathway, but not the JNK or p38 MAPKs, or the previously reported PKC α / β signal pathway. Therefore, p-ERK1/2 plays a major role in TPA-mediated LCN2 gene induction.",

    "fig 7": "Our previous study showed that mRNA levels of MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXR β could be induced by TPA, indicating they could be TPA-responsive element- (TRE-) binding proteins [ 19 ]. In order to reveal whether the expressions of these new TRE-binding proteins were regulated by the MEK-ERK signal pathway, we detected the mRNA levels of the above genes in EC109 cells treated with MEK inhibitors. The results showed that the TPA-induced transcription of these genes is not inhibited by MEK inhibitors ( Figure 7 ).",
    "fig 8": "TPA has been long used as a carcinogenesis promoting agent in various models [ 21 ]. Our previous study found that TPA could induce immortalization of esophageal epithelial cells (SHEEs) into cancer cells (SHEECs) [ 22 ]. During this progression, the LCN2 gene is upregulated, indicating the LCN2 expression could be induced by TPA [ 18 ]. We further showed that LCN2 gene could be induced by TPA and might contain a novel TPA-responsive element (TRE) in −152~−60 bp of its promoter. Five nucleoproteins MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXR β were identified by oligonucleotide trapping, as the binding factors on the TRE under TPA stimulation, and were expressed at varying expression levels in esophageal cancer [ 19 , 20 ]. However, the signaling pathways that participate in these events are poorly understood. In this study, we identify the signal transduction pathway of TPA-induced LCN2 expression in esophageal cancer. MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXR β respond to TPA stimulation and enhance the transcriptional expression of LCN2 . MEK → ERK, JNK, and p38 were found to regulate the TPA-induced LCN2 expression, especially the MEK → ERK pathway. The previously reported TPA-PKC α / β does not appear to be involved in this process. Our results lead to a model involving MEK → ERK as being the major signaling pathway in TPA-induced LCN2 expression, and MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXR β are the nuclear transcription factors that respond to TPA-mediated regulation of LCN2 transcription ( Figure 8 )."
