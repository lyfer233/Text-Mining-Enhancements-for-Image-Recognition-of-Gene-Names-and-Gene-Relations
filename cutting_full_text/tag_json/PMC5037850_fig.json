    "Figure 1": "In response to various stressors, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated and phosphorylates c-Jun, which increases the activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). AP-1 modulates the transcription genes such as  Fas ligand  ( FasL ) to induce apoptosis via an extrinsic pathway. JNK also appears to activate non-nuclear substrates (such as Bcl-2 family members) to promote cell death via an intrinsic pathway. 6-OHDA: 6-hydroxydopamine."
