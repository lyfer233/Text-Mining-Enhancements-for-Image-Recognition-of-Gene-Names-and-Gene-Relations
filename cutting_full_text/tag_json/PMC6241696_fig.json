    "Figure 4": "Mechanistic regulatory network of FSH to cervical cancer, mediated through the PKA-NF-κB pathway. Note:  After PKA activates FSH, GSK-3β activity is downregulated, which induces the inactivation of the NF-κB pathway to decrease the cell cycle and activate cell apoptosis. Abbreviations:  FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; PKA, protein kinase A; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; CASP3, Caspase 3."
