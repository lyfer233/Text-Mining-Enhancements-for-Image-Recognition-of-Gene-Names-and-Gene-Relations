    "Figure 2.": "The MyD88-IL-12-IFN-γ axis is important for  P. acnes- induced LPS sensitization. After systemic treatment with heat-killed  P. acnes , the Kupffer cells ingested the bacteria and activated the TLR-MyD88-NF-κB pathway, thereby producing IL-12. In response to the IL-12 expression, lymphocytes produced IFN-γ, which eventually activated dense granulomas consisting of macrophages in the liver."
