    "Figure 6": "The proposed mechanism of apoptosis induction by 3-cloroplumbagin (ChPL) in breast cancer cells. ChPL inhibits MAP kinase signaling and induces apoptosis through the activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway, involving the downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins."
