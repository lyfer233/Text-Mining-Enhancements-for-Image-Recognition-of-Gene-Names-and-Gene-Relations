      <abstract>
        <p><bold>Background</bold>: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process whereby epithelial cells lose cell-cell contacts and acquire expression of mesenchymal components and manifest a migratory phenotype. Recent studies indicated that EMT is involved in the development of keloids. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the mechanisms of the effects of metformin in hypoxia-induced EMT in keloid fibroblasts (KFs).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods</bold>: KFs were cultured in a hypoxia incubator to induce EMT and were treated with or without metformin. Cell viability was evaluated by a cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), and cell migration was measured by the transwell assay. The expression levels of HIF-1&#x3B1;, E-cadherin, vimentin, phosphorylated p70s6k (p-p70s6k) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) were evaluated by western blotting.</p>
        <p><bold>Results</bold>: Hypoxia promoted EMT in KFs. Metformin significantly inhibited the expression of HIF-1&#x3B1; and partially abolished hypoxia-induced EMT. PKM2 is involved in hypoxia-induced EMT of KFs and metformin decreased the expression of p-p70s6k and PKM2.</p>
        <p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Metformin abolishes hypoxia-induced EMT in KFs by inhibiting the HIF-1&#x3B1;/PKM2 signaling pathway. Our study provides a novel mechanistic insight into potential use of metformin for treatment of keloids.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Keloids are typically formed during abnormal wound healing that extends beyond the site of the original skin injury <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. The formation of a keloid always results in physical discomfort, functional limitation, and psychological impairment <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The inside of keloids frequently exhibit ischemic-hypoxic states due to the destruction of the vascular network and excessive oxygen consumption during inflammation and repair <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is one of the key mediators of the hypoxic stress response <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Our previous studies have demonstrated that HIF-1&#x3B1; activates the TGF-&#x3B2;1/Smad signaling pathway and increases collagen deposition in the dermal fibroblasts in response to hypoxic conditions <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p>
      <p>The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process associated with the loss of polarity of epithelial cells and their development into mesenchymal cells with invasive and migratory properties <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; EMT is ubiquitous in wound healing, organ fibrosis and development of cancer <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. During EMT, the expression of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), are decreased and the expression of mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin and fibronectin, are increased, thus resulting in nonpolar mobilizable cells. Recently, EMT was detected in the keloid tissues. Hypoxia-rich environments in keloids induced elevated levels of HIF-1&#x3B1; and promoted the transformation of the keloid-derived keratinocytes into fibroblast-like cells via the activation of EMT <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p>
      <p>Metformin is a typical antidiabetic drug that has significant antitumor effects in several types of human cancer <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Metformin is recently reported to regulate cell energy metabolism <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and repress EMT by inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Furthermore, metformin regulates the EMT process by inhibiting the expression of Vimentin, thus destroying the invasive phenotype induced by TGF-&#x3B2;1 in human cervical cancer cells <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Most importantly, metformin is suggested to exert an anti-keloid effect<italic> in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. However, the complete mechanism of metformin-induced inhibition of keloid growth remains unknown.</p>
      <p>The aim of the current study was to explore the mechanism of the effects of metformin in keloid fibroblasts. We found that metformin can reverse EMT by downregulation of HIF-1&#x3B1;, p-p70s6k and PKM2, suggesting that metformin is involved in the HIF-1&#x3B1;/PKM2 signaling pathway to inhibit keloid development.</p>

        <p>Primary human keloid fibroblasts (KFs) and normal skin fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated according to the protocol as previously described <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Briefly, the surgically excised human keloid tissues and adjacent normal skin tissues were cut away of epidermis and fat manually. Only the dermal layer of the fibrous tissues were reserved and then cut into smaller pieces. These small pieces were digested in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) lysis buffer with 1x collagenase for 2 hours. After centrifugation, the precipitates were collected and cultured in DMEM (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic and 15% fetal bovine serum (10099-141; Gibco) in 5% CO2 at 37&#xB0;C. Metformin (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) was stocked at a concentration of 50 mM at 4 &#xB0;C. The cells were treated with 10, 15, 20 mM metformin and collected for CCK8. The cells treated with 10 mM metformin were collected for migration assay, PCR, and Western blot.</p>

        <p>Metformin has been showed to inhibit the proliferation and collagen synthesis of the human keloids fibroblasts <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Here, we further evaluated the effects of metformin on viability and migration of KFs in a hypoxic environment. The results of the CCK-8 assay showed that metformin inhibited the growth of KFs in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A).

        <p>Metformin repression of HIF-1&#x3B1; expression was analyzed by western blotting; the data indicate that HIF-1&#x3B1; expression in KFs under hypoxic condition was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of metformin (10mM), the results were confirmed by densitometric quantified analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). However, metformin did not affect the mRNA levels of HIF-1&#x3B1;, suggesting that metformin decreased the posttranslational levels of HIF-1&#x3B1; (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Moreover, immunofluorescence staining confirmed that metformin inhibited the expression of the HIF-1&#x3B1; protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C).</p>

        <title>PKM2 is required for HIF-1&#x3B1;-induced EMT</title>
        <p>PKM2 is essential for TGF-&#x3B2;1-induced EMT in cancer cells and knockdown of PKM2 failed to induce spindle-shaped morphological changes and EMT-related alterations in the TGF-&#x3B2;1-treated colorectal cancer cells<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. We have previously proved that HIF-1&#x3B1; could activate TGF-&#x3B2;1 expression to promote collagen deposition in dermal fibroblasts<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Therefore, we tested whether PKM2 plays a critical role in HIF-1-induced EMT in KFs. We found that PKM2 knockdown reduced the HIF-1&#x3B1;-induced loss of E-cadherin and gain of vimentin in KFs under hypoxic condition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). We also confirmed the results by densitometric quantified analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Furthermore, PKM2 silencing decreased the migratory ability of KFs compared with that of the control group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Metformin reverses EMT in keloids through inhibition of the HIF-1&#x3B1;/PKM2 pathway</title>
        <p>We further investigated the mechanism of metformin effects involved in the regulation of EMT in keloid. The results showed that metformin rescued the accumulation of vimentin and decreased the levels of E-cadherin in hypoxia-treated KFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, 4B). Additionally, we found that stimulation by hypoxia increased the phosphorylation of p70s6k and upregulated the expression of PKM2 in KFs. Hence, metformin reversed hypoxia-induced EMT by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p70s6k and suppressing expression of PKM2 in KFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, 4B).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that HIF-1&#x3B1; plays a pivotal role in promoting cancer metastasis <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. HIF-1&#x3B1; promotes fibrogenesis and ECM accumulation in a wide range of tumors through EMT <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Keloid predominantly develops after a trauma; the cutaneous vascular network is always disrupted leading to a hypoxic environment in the local tissue. Moreover, high metabolic state during tissue injury-induced inflammation and repair dramatically increases oxygen consumption and exacerbates the hypoxia <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. As a result, HIF-1&#x3B1; is always upregulated in keloids due to the hypoxic microenvironment. HIF-1&#x3B1; induced the transformation of keloid-derived keratinocytes into fibroblast-like cells through EMT allowing the keloid fibroblasts to extend beyond the wound margin <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Our results proved that metformin can significantly inhibit HIF-1&#x3B1; expression and subsequently impair EMT.</p>
      <p>PKM2 is a downstream effector of mTOR that plays a crucial role in aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. PKM2 is essential for TGF-induced EMT in several human cancers <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. The HIF-1&#x3B1; and c-Myc-hnRNP cascades are essential mediators of mTOR-dependent regulation of PKM2 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. PKM2 is a critical downstream effector of the HIF-1&#x3B1;-related signaling pathways and is the key glycolytic enzyme <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. In this study, we observed that PKM2 is critical for HIF-1&#x3B1;-induced EMT in KFs because silencing of PKM2 reversed hypoxia-induced EMT. The phosphorylation of the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a downstream effector of mTOR, plays a critical role in controlling cell growth. Deactivation of S6K1 leads to cell proliferation at a smaller size and at a reduced rate <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Our results indicate that hypoxia induced the expression of PKM2 and p70s6k, suggesting that PKM2 and p70s6k are involved in EMT in keloids. Moreover, we demonstrated that metformin inhibited the HIF-1&#x3B1;/PKM2 signaling pathway and reversed hypoxia-induced EMT in KFs.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In the current study, we proved that hypoxic environment promoted KF migration by activating HIF-1&#x3B1;-induced EMT. Metformin inhibits hypoxia-induced EMT of KFs via the HIF-1&#x3B1;/PKM2 signaling pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Based on these data, we propose that the HIF-1&#x3B1;/PKM2 pathway is involved in hypoxia-induced EMT in keloids. Therefore, metformin may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of keloids.</p>
