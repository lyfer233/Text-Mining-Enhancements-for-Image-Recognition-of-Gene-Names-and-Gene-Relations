      <abstract>
        <p>Dysregulation of collagen production contributes to various pathological processes, including tissue fibrosis as well as impaired wound healing. Lipo-prostaglandin E1 (Lipo-PGE1), a lipid microsphere-incorporated prostaglandin E1, is used as a vasodilator for the treatment of peripheral vascular diseases. Lipo-PGE1 was recently shown to enhance human dermal fibroblast (HDF) migration and <italic>in vivo</italic> wound healing. No published study has characterized the role of Lipo-PGE1 in collagen regulation in HDFs. Here, we investigated the cellular signaling mechanism by which Lipo-PGE1 regulates collagen in HDFs. Collagen production was evaluated by the Sircol collagen assay, Western blot analysis of type I collagen and real time PCR. Unexpectedly, Lipo-PGE1 decreased mRNA expression of collagen 1A1, 1A2, and 3A1. Lipo-PGE1 markedly inhibited type I collagen and total soluble collagen production. In addition, Lipo-PGE1 inhibited transforming growth factor-&#x3B2;-induced collagen expression via Smad2 phosphorylation. To further investigate whether extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Ets-1 signaling, a crucial pathway in collagen regulation, is involved in Lipo-PGE1-inhibited collagen production, cells were pretreated with an ERK-specific inhibitor, PD98059, prior to the addition of Lipo-PGE1. Lipo-PGE1-inhibited collagen mRNA expression and total soluble collagen production were recovered by pretreatment with PD98059. Moreover, Lipo-PGE1 directly induced the phosphorylation of ERK. Furthermore, silencing of Ets-1 recovered Lipo-PGE1-inhibited collagen production and PD98059 blocked Lipo-PGE1-enhanced Ets-1 expression. The present study reveals an important role for Lipo-PGE1 as a negative regulator of collagen gene expression and production via ERK/Ets-1 signaling. These results suggest that Lipo-PGE1 could potentially be a therapeutic target in diseases with deregulated collagen turnover.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), one of the main cell types in the skin, play a key role in the pathophysiology of fibrotic diseases as well as in cutaneous wound repair [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179614.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dermal fibroblasts facilitate wound healing through enhancement of their migration, proliferation, and collagen production. Collagen, one of the most plentiful and ubiquitous proteins in the human body, is a major component of extracellular connective tissue matrix (ECM) [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179614.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Type I collagen is approximately 80% of the total collagen in adult human dermis and type III collagen, which predominates in gastrointestinal and vascular connective tissues, represents approximately 10% of the total collagen in the adult human dermis [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179614.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although collagen production after injury is normally essential for the process of wound healing, excessive collagen synthesis results in an altered tissue structure and consequently leads to a variety of fibrotic disorders such as hypertrophic scars, keloids, scleroderma/systemic sclerosis, liver cirrhosis, and Crohn&#x2019;s disease. The initiation and progression stages of fibrosis are affected by several growth factors and cytokines secreted from inflammatory cells. In particular, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x3B2;, a major regulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, stimulates the proliferation and activation of dermal fibroblasts and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis and scar remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During these processes, Smad 2/3 pathways and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Ets-1 signaling control scar remodeling and fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179614.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179614.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Lipo-prostaglandin E1 (Lipo-PGE1, Alprostadil) is a lipid emulsion of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) that is used as a vasodilator in the treatment of peripheral vascular diseases. PGE1 accelerates the repair of skin ulcers and limb ischemia. Our recent study demonstrated that Lipo-PGE1 directly facilitates wound healing <italic>in vivo</italic> and increases HDF migration through the enhancement of CXCR4 [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite the beneficial effects of Lipo-PGE1 during the proliferation/migration phases of wound healing, the regulatory effect of Lipo-PGE1 on collagen synthesis and the underlying detailed mechanism are not well known.</p>

Real-time PCR was performed using the 7900 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) with Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). The relative levels of gene expression were calculated using the expression of GAPDH as an internal standard. The cycling profile for real-time PCR (40 cycles) was as follows: 95&#xB0;C for 2 min, 95&#xB0;C for 5 sec, and 60&#xB0;C for 30 sec.

        <title>Lipo-PGE1 suppresses collagen expression in human adult and keloids fibroblasts</title>
        <p>To examine the effect of Lipo-PGE1 on collagen expression in HDFs, cells were treated with various doses (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 ng/ml) of Lipo-PGE1 for 24 h and collagen mRNA expression and cell viability were measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, COL1A1 COL1A2, and COL3A1 mRNA synthesis was decreased by all the tested doses of Lipo-PGE1, except 40 ng/mL. Concurrently, there was no toxic effect up to 40 ng/ml of Lipo-PGE1 on HDFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179614.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). To further evaluate the effects of Lipo-PGE1 on types I collagen protein, accounts for around 80% in adult human dermis, Western blot analysis of types I collagen was performed. Type I collagen expression was also decreased by Lipo-PGE1, showing the maximal effect with 5 ng/mL Lipo-PGE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Next, time kinetics were measured by the Sircol collagen assay for 12&#x2013;48 hours. Total soluble collagen was also decreased by Lipo-PGE1 treatment in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To further examine the effects of Lipo-PGE1 on collagen synthesis in a pro-fibrotic response, its influence on cells stimulated with TGF-&#x3B2;, an important regulator of fibrosis and the pathogenesis of fibrotic disorders, was evaluated. TGF-&#x3B2; treatment induced collagen gene and protein expression in HDFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Lipo-PGE1 significantly suppressed TGF-&#x3B2;-induced COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 mRNA expression and total soluble collagen level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Moreover, Western blot analysis indicated that TGF-&#x3B2;-induced type I collagen expression was also reversed by Lipo-PGE1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). To clarify whether the downregulation of collagen by Lipo-PGE1 is mediated via TGF-&#x3B2;/Smad signaling pathway, we determined the effects of Lipo-PGE1 on Smad 2/3 phosphorylation. Lipo-PGE1 also inhibited TGF- &#x3B2; induction of Smad2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Unfortunately, Smad3 phosphorylation was not detected due to low expression levels on HDFs. In addition, we examined whether Lipo-PGE1 regulates collagen gene expression in primary human fibroblasts derived from keloids. Lipo-PGE1 also decreased COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 mRNA expression (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179614.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and the total soluble collagen level (Fig B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179614.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) in keloid fibroblasts. These data suggest that Lipo-PGE1 could be involved in negative regulation of collagen expression in human keloid fibroblast as well as normal fibroblast.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study showed that Lipo-PGE1 negatively regulates collagen synthesis in HDFs. Our data further showed that Lipo-PGE1 strongly inhibits collagen production via an ERK- and Ets-1-dependent pathway. To our knowledge, this is first report that Lipo-PGE1 has inhibitory effects on collagen synthesis in fibroblasts. According to our previous report, Lipo-PGE1 accelerates wound healing <italic>in vivo</italic> and increases CXCR4-mediated migration of HDFs. In fact, we anticipated that Lipo-PGE1 would increase collagen production; however, unexpectedly, Lipo-PGE1 significantly inhibited collagen synthesis. Interestingly, total soluble collagen was significantly decreased by Lipo-PGE1 treatment in a time-dependent manner whereas Lipo-PGE1 non-treated group naturally and gradually enhances collagen production in HDFs as time goes on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), suggesting potential candidate to treat in scar remodeling and diseases with deregulated collagen turnover. Although Lipo-PGE1 has beneficial effects for the wound healing process, which facilitate <italic>in vivo</italic> wound healing and fibroblast migration, it can also considerably inhibit collagen synthesis. Therefore, it is likely to be appropriate for scar remodeling as well as for modulating the proliferation/migration phases, resulting in direct effects on wound healing in patients. Furthermore, Lipo-PGE1 also suppresses platelet aggregation. Taken together, this suggests that the dosage and timing of Lipo-PGE1 application should be considered for effective enhancement of wound healing and scar remodeling.</p>
      <p>The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 has many functions such as enhancing wound repair, angiogenesis, and chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that LL-37 suppresses collagen synthesis, suggesting it has an anti-fibrotic function [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, we wondered whether Lipo-PGE1 regulates the LL-37 level, given that they have similar functions such as facilitating wound repair and inhibiting fibrosis in HDFs. Lipo-PGE1 treatment considerably increased LL-37 secretion in human HDFs (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179614.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In addition, Lipo-PGE1 strongly suppressed the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), an important mediator of fibrosis and scar formation (Fig B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179614.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179614.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These data suggest that, in addition to its direct effects, other factors and mechanisms can mediate indirect effects of Lipo-PGE1 on collagen synthesis.</p>
      <p>According to a recent study by Sobota <italic>et al</italic>., PGE1 induces MAPK signaling [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Specifically, Park <italic>et al</italic>. reported that ERK/Ets-1 activation plays a significant role in the inhibition of collagen synthesis signaling [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179614.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, the present study examined the involvement of ERK/Ets-1 signaling in Lipo-PGE1-inhibited collagen production in HDFs. The ERK inhibitor PD98059 recovered Lipo-PGE1-induced collagen inhibition in HDFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Treatment with Ets-1-targeting siRNA blocked the downregulation of collagen expression by Lipo-PGE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>), demonstrating that ERK/Ets-1 signaling is involved in these processes. Recent evidence suggests that a member of the Ets transcription factor family, Fli1, contributes to key repression of collagen synthesis, notably that of the human COL1A2 gene [<xref rid="pone.0179614.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, Lipo-PGE1 increased Fli1 expression, in addition to that of Ets-1 (Fig C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179614.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Thus, the Ets-1 family mediates the inhibition of collagen expression by Lipo-PGE1, suggesting that Lipo-PGE1 has anti-collagenic and anti-fibrogenic effects on HDFs. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the detailed mechanisms underlying Lipo-PGE1-induced collagen regulation in human HDFs and the factors involved.</p>
      <p>In summary, the present study demonstrated the regulatory effect of Lipo-PGE1 on collagen production in HDFs. Additionally, Lipo-PGE1 down-regulates TGF-&#x3B2;-induced collagen. Our data further show that the ERK/Ets-1 pathway is involved in suppression of collagen production by Lipo-PGE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179614.g005">Fig 5</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first report that Lipo-PGE1 has inhibitory effects on collagen production in fibroblasts, further suggesting that Lipo-PGE1 is an effective candidate to treat keloids and fibrosis.</p>

          <p>Lipo-PGE1 strongly inhibits collagen synthesis in HDFs. Furthermore, an ERK- and Ets-1-dependent pathway is involved in Lipo-PGE1-inhibited collagen production. Lipo-PGE1 can be modulated to down-regulate collagen synthesis in human HDFs and may provide a therapeutic approach to inhibit fibrosis and its roles in the pathogenesis of skin disorders.</p>
