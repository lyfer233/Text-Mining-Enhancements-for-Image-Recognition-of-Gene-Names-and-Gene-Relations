      <abstract>
        <p>The biomechanics stress and chronic inflammation in obesity are causally linked to osteoarthritis. However, the metabolic factors mediating obesity-related osteoarthritis are still obscure. Here we scanned and identified at least two elevated metabolites (stearic acid and lactate) from the plasma of diet-induced obese mice. We found that stearic acid potentiated LDH-a-dependent production of lactate, which further stabilized HIF1&#x3B1; protein and increased VEGF and proinflammatory cytokine expression in primary mouse chondrocytes. Treatment with LDH-a and HIF1&#x3B1; inhibitors notably attenuated stearic acid-or high fat diet-stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, positive correlation of plasma lactate, cartilage HIF1&#x3B1; and cytokine levels with the body mass index was observed in subjects with osteoarthritis. In conclusion, saturated free fatty acid induced proinflammatory cytokine production partly through activation of a novel lactate-HIF1&#x3B1; pathway in chondrocytes. Our findings hold promise of developing novel clinical strategies for the management of obesity-related diseases such as osteoarthritis.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by irreversible destruction of the joint cartilage, is a most common rheumatic disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Overnutrition-induced obesity is suggested to be a crucial contributor of the onset and progression of OA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, with the molecular mechanism being largely unknown. Previous studies revealed that two aspects might be the initiators of obesity-related OA. One is the biomechanics stress in obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and the other is obesity-induced low grade inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, characterized by activation of proinflammatory signaling pathway (TLR4, NF-&#x3BA;B, JNK, etc) and elevation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1&#x3B2;, TNF-&#x3B1;, etc) in multiple organs and tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
    <p>Actually, besides some cytokines and hormones (VEGF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, leptin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, etc), some increased metabolites are also potent mediators of chronic inflammation in obesity. Saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) are well-documented stimulators of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in macrophages, and contribute to obesity-related chronic inflammation and insulin resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Cholesterols play important roles in the recruitment of macrophages and onset of inflammation in adipose tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Our previous studies revealed that deficiency of comparative gene identification-58 in macrophages induced lipid accumulation and systemic inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
    <p>Obesity-induced metabolites regulate proinflammatory cytokine production through a large sum of transcription factors, like NF-&#x3BA;B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, forkhead box-containing protein O subfamily-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, etc. HIFs are composed of two dimeric subunits: an oxygen-sensitive &#x3B1; subunit (HIF1&#x3B1; or HIF2&#x3B1;) and a ubiquitously and constitutively expressed &#x3B2; subunit (HIF1&#x3B2;)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Under normal conditions, HIF1&#x3B1; is hydroxylated by prolylhydroxylases, ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase and targeted for proteolytic degradation via the proteasomal pathway. The hydroxylation step is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, resulting in stabilization of HIF1&#x3B1;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p>
    <p>Recently, HIF1&#x3B1; was reported to be a proinflammatory transcription factor in adipose tissue in obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The obesity state-induced hypoxia was suggested to be a major stimulator of HIF1&#x3B1; expression and activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Excessive oxidation of FFAs in obesity consumed too much oxygen, leading to a hypoxia circumstance. Consequently, lactic acid/lactate will be abundantly produced via increased glycolysis. However, the relationships between the metabolic factors (FFAs, lactate, etc), HIF1&#x3B1; and inflammation are still not fully understood. Here in this study, we demonstrate that the high fat diet (HFD) and stearic acid induce lactate production in mice and chondrocytes, respectively. The increased lactate stabilizes HIF1&#x3B1;, partly mediating FFAs-stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production in chondrocytes. Our findings revealed a novel molecular mechanism linking obesity to OA.</p>

        <title>Increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF in the plasma and chondrocytes in the HFD-feeding mice</title>
        <p>To verify the positive correlation between obesity and OA, we set up an obese mouse model by feeding the mice with a HFD for 8 weeks. Consistent with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, HFD induced a low grade inflammation state, characterized by elevated production of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), TNF-&#x3B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and IL-1&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) in plasma. Meanwhile, plasma VEGF, a well-documented risk factor of OA, was also induced by HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Further, the expression pattern of chondrocyte cytokines was identical with the aforementioned ones in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e~h</xref>). These results indicated that the HFD induced a low grade inflammation in the mouse cartilages. However, the 8 weeks of HFD-feeding mice didn&#x2019;t display any signs of osteoarthritis in histomorphology (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>HFD-induced plasma stearic acid and lactate stimulates proinflammatory cytokine and VEGF production in primary chondrocytes</title>
        <p>To explore whether the serum-derived factors are contributors of the chondrocyte inflammation, we collected the serum from the mice with a normal diet (ND) or HFD for 8 weeks. The full serum was then separated into a protein fraction (&gt;3&#x2009;KD) and a metabolite fraction (&lt;3&#x2009;KD) to treat the primary chondrocytes from the ND-feeding mice. Comparing to the full serum, protein fraction and metabolite fraction from the ND group, the ones from HFD group notably stimulated mRNA expression of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), TNF-&#x3B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and IL-1&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Unexpectedly, the mRNA expression of VEGF was induced by the HFD group-derived full serum and metabolite fraction but not by the protein fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). While it has been proven that proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x3B1;, IL-1&#x3B2;, etc) are present at high levels in the protein fraction of serum from the HFD-feeding mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, the proinflammatory molecules in the metabolite fraction of the serum are still not well-known. We performed metabonomics analysis of the metabolite fraction with GC-TOF-MS (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), and verified that at least two elevated metabolic molecules, stearic acid (a kind of saturated FFAs) and lactate in obesity, were functional stimulators of proinflammatory cytokine and VEGF production in primary chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e~l</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism linking stearic acid and lactate to the cytokine production in chondrocytes will be further explored.</p>

        <title>Stearic acid and lactate induced inflammation response by enhancing protein stability and transcription activity of HIF1&#x3B1; in chondrocytes</title>
        <p>It&#x2019;s well established that lactic acid is largely produced in hypoxia state, which increases stability and activity of HIF1&#x3B1;, a recently characterized enhancer of chronic inflammation in adipose tissue in obese mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Specially, stearic acid and lactate-induced VEGF is a well-known transcriptional target of HIF1&#x3B1;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Thus, we presumed that stearic acid and lactate might regulate the protein stability and transcriptional activity of HIF1&#x3B1;. As expected, similar to hypoxia, both stearic acid and lactate induced protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b~d</xref>) and transcription activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f~h</xref>) of HIF1&#x3B1; in primary chondrocytes. Furthermore, we confirmed that metabolite fraction of serum from the HFD-feeding mice notably induced HIF1&#x3B1; protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>) and transcription activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>).</p>
        <p>To verify whether stearic acid and lactate induced cytokine production through HIF1&#x3B1;, mouse HIF1&#x3B1; specific siRNAs were employed to silence the expression of HIF1&#x3B1; in primary mouse chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). As expected, stearic acid-induced production of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), TNF-&#x3B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and IL-1&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) could be partly blocked by HIF1&#x3B1; silence, while stearic acid-stimulated VEGF expression was fully prevented by HIF1&#x3B1; deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). In contrast, lactate-induced expression of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>), TNF-&#x3B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>), IL-1&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>) and VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i</xref>) could be fully diminished by HIF1&#x3B1; silence. Those results indicated that stearic acid mediated inflammation response partly through HIF1&#x3B1;, while lactate induced inflammation response in a HIF1&#x3B1;-dependent manner in chondrocytes.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Stearic acid potentiates LDH-a-dependent lactate production in chondrocytes</title>
        <p>Given that both stearic acid and lactate could mimic the hypoxia state and regulate HIF1&#x3B1; activity, we presumed that there might be a reciprocal regulatory role between stearic acid and lactate. In primary mouse chondrocytes, lactate treatment exerted no effects on the production of free fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), while the treatment with stearic acid notably induced lactate production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Further, we demonstrated that stearic acid could induce the expression of LDH-a, a key enzyme for lactate production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). siRNA-mediated LDH-a silence abolished stearic acid-stimulated lactate production in primary mouse chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c~d</xref>). To confirm the stimulatory role of stearic acid on lactate production via LDH-a, an inhibitor (Oxamate) of LDH-a activity was employed and identical results were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were performed to verify the aforementioned findings <italic>in vitro</italic>. The HFD treatment stimulated the levels of free fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>) and lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>) in mouse plasma in a time-dependent manner. Likewise, the plasma VEGF exerted a similar altering pattern as free fatty acids and lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Interestingly, the HFD-induced lactate production was abolished by additional treatment with the LDH-a inhibitor Oxamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5i</xref>).</p>

        <title>Stearic acid stimulates LDH-a-dependent production of proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF</title>
        <p>Saturated free fatty acid is the well-documented stimulator of TLR4, mediating inflammation response ubiquitously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To identify whether TLR4 is involved in LDH-a/lactate pathway-mediated cytokine production, stearic acid-induced inflammation response in primary chondrocytes with TLR4 or LDH-a silence was observed. Stearic acid-induced mRNA levels of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), TNF-&#x3B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>) and IL-1&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>) were largely decreased by a single silence of TLR4 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>) or LDH-a. Combined silence of TLR4 and LDH-a could fully prevent stearic acid-induced proinflammatory cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a~c</xref>). Thus we concluded that stearic acid/LDH-a/lactate pathway was TLR4-independent. Interestingly, stearic acid-stimulated VEGF expression was fully blocked by the silence of LDH-a, but not by TLR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). To verify the aforementioned <italic>in vitro</italic> pathway (stearic acid/LDH-a/cytokines) <italic>in vivo</italic>, we treated the HFD-feeding mice with inhibitors of TLR4 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>), LDH-a or HIF1&#x3B1; (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3c</xref>) and observed cytokine production in mouse cartilage. The HFD-feeding stimulated mRNA expression of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>), TNF-&#x3B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>) and IL-1&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>), and this effect was partly attenuated by a single treatment of TLR4, LDH-a or HIF1&#x3B1; inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e~g</xref>). Simultaneous administration with TLR4 and LDH-a inhibitors fully prevented HFD-feeding-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in mouse cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e~g</xref>). It should be noted that the HFD-feeding-stimulated VEGF expression was prevented by LDH-a or HIF1&#x3B1; inhibitors, but not by TLR4 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref>). These results verified that stearic acid/LDH-a/HIF1&#x3B1; was a TLR4-independent novel pathway in chondrocytes.</p>

        <title>Positive correlation of plasma lactate, cartilage HIF1&#x3B1; and cytokine levels with the body mass index (BMI) in patients with OA</title>
        <p>Aforementioned results revealed that lactate/HIF1&#x3B1; pathway was involved in saturated free fatty acid-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF. To further correlate this mechanism to physiological condition, we investigated the levels of plasma lactate, cartilage HIF1&#x3B1; and cytokines in age-matched female human donors with OA. Results revealed that production of plasma lactate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>), cartilage HIF1&#x3B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>), IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>), TNF-&#x3B1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>), IL-1&#x3B2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>) and VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>) were positively correlated with the BMI in human donors.</p>

      <p>Obesity is causally linked to OA, with the molecular mechanism being not fully understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Biomechanics stress (overweight), cytokines (IL-6, TNF-&#x3B1;, IL-1&#x3B2;, VEGF, etc) and hormones (leptin, etc) were identified as key risk factors linking obesity to the setup and progression of OA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, the metabolic changes in obesity affecting the cytokine production were still obscure. Here in this study, we are the first to demonstrate that stearic acid stimulated LDH-a-dependent production of lactate, which further stabilized HIF1&#x3B1; protein, and promoted OA-related cytokine expression in chondrocytes. Our work identified a novel pathway (LDH-a/HIF1&#x3B1;/cytokines) mediating saturated free fatty acid-induced cytokine production, independent of TLR4 signaling in chondrocytes.</p>
      <p>The levels of saturated free fatty acids (stearic acid, etc) in plasma were increased in obese individuals. Those saturated free fatty acids exerted proinflammatory roles through TLR4 in multiple cells, including monocytes, macrophages, adipocytes and chondrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In this study, we demonstrated that stearic acid-induced LDH-a/lactate axis was TLR4-independent. However, the precise mechanism linking free fatty acids to LDH-a expression is still not clear. Previous studies revealed that uptake of free fatty acids were increased in multiple cells in obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We presumed that the chondrocytes might also be overloaded with fatty acids and the over-consumption of oxygen in fatty acid oxidation might generate a hypoxic circumstance, inducing LDH-a-dependent glycolysis and lactate production in chondrocytes.</p>
      <p>Lactate was known to stabilize HIF1&#x3B1; protein under normoxia conditions in a latest study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, which is consistent with our present work. The role of lactate in inflammation was contradicted in different cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Here we identified the proinflammatory role of lactate via HIF1&#x3B1; in chondrocytes. Interestingly, the production of lactate was tightly potentiated by saturated free fatty acid in obesity. Those findings indicated that lactate might also be a linker between obesity and OA. However, the precise mechanism of lactate stabilizing HIF1&#x3B1; protein needs further to be investigated.</p>
      <p>HIFs are pivotal transcriptional factors which are tightly regulated by oxygen concentration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. HIF1&#x3B1; and HIF2&#x3B1; regulate different subgroups of genes, although they share some common targets such as VEGF and GLUT1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In arginine metabolism, HIF1&#x3B1; stimulated iNOS production, while HIF2&#x3B1; induced arginase expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In fat tissues of obese mice, HIF1&#x3B1; potentiated proinflammatory cytokine production, while HIF2&#x3B1; attenuated chronic inflammation and insulin resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In the present study, we identified that HIF1&#x3B1;, could mediate stearic acid-stimulated inflammatory response in chondrocytes. The specific activation of stearic acid on HIF1&#x3B1; protein is interesting and needs further to be explored.</p>
      <p>In all, we identified that elevated circulatory metabolite stearic acid increased lactate levels in the plasma and chondrocytes in a LDH-a-dependent manner. The stearic acid stimulated VEGF and proinflammatory cytokine production through a canonic TLR4 pathway and a novel lactate/HIF1&#x3B1; pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). The molecules in both pathways might be potential diagnostic markers and functional therapeutic targets.</p>

All the mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility with a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle in TMMU. All the mice were provided with food and purified water ad libitum. Each cage contained no more than 5 mice. Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed with either a normal diet (ND) provided by TMMU (The ingredient is identical with the Research Diets D12450B, 10% calories from fat, Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) or a high fat diet (HFD, D12492, fat content 60% by calorie, Research diets, Inc.). The 8-week-ND or HFD-feeding male C57BL/6 mice were treated with LDH-a inhibitor oxamate (#O2751, Sigma, 500&#x2009;mg/kg.d), HIF1&#x3B1; inhibitor KG-548 (#SML0619, Sigma, 1&#x2009;mg/kg.d) or Toll-like receptor 4 inhibitor (TLR4-I) (#SML0832, Sigma, 1&#x2009;mg/kg.d) for 14 days (from the seventh week of HFD) via intraperitoneal injection.

        <title>Proposed models for FFA/lactate-mediated HIF1&#x3B1;-cytokine axis in obesity-related osteoarthritis.</title>
        <p>Briefly, circulatory levels of saturate FFA are increased in diet-induced obesity. Saturated FFA could stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production in chondrocytes directly through TLR4. Meanwhile, the elevated FFA stimulates LDH-a-dependent lactate production in chondrocytes and perhaps also in other cells. Consequently, the levels of circulatory lactate are also increased in response to HFD treatment. The increased lactate would stabilize and activate HIF-1&#x3B1; protein in chondrocytes to stimulate the production of VEGF and proinflammatory cytokines. In summary, saturated FFA could stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production in chondrocytes directly through TLR4 or LDHa-lactate-HIF1&#x3B1; pathway, which provides a potential molecular mechanism linking obesity to chronic inflammation in osteoarthritis.</p>
