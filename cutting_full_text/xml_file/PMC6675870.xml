      <abstract>
        <p>Resistance acquired toward anti-cancer agents is a significant drawback in breast cancer therapy. A key factor contributing to drug resistance is apoptosis suppression associated with the upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Specifically, the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein has been shown to play a significant role in drug resistance, making it an important therapeutic target. The present study aimed at determining the antiproliferative activity of 3-chloroplumbagin (ChPL), a naphthoquinone derived from a <italic>Dionaea</italic> sp., toward breast cancer cells and examining the involvement of Mcl-1 inhibition in ChPL-induced cell death. The results showed that ChPL inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway through down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. The induction of apoptosis by ChPL was found to be mediated through MAP kinase signaling inhibition. ChPL inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK proteins in breast cancer cells, and increased apoptosis induction in cells with reduced ERK expression. Furthermore, ERK silencing decreased the expression of Mcl-1 in ChPL-treated cells. The results of this research indicate that ChPL induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through MAPK-mediated Mcl-1 inhibition, suggesting further research into its potential in breast cancer treatment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Breast cancer is among the most frequently diagnosed cancers in the female population. Despite advances in breast cancer treatment, a major obstacle in treatment remains resistance acquired toward therapy. One of the factors associated with resistance to therapy is the evasion of apoptosis by cancer cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hanahan et al., 2000</xref>). Specifically, the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins has been shown to suppress cell death induced by cytotoxic anticancer drugs (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yip and Reed, 2008</xref>). The majority of cytotoxic anticancer agents depend to a large extent on the intrinsic, Bcl-2/Bax-dependent mechanism of cell death induction. This renders the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins important targets in cancer drug design (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yip and Reed, 2008</xref>). The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> proteins have been the main focus of targeted inhibitor design (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Vogler et al., 2009</xref>). However, recent research has pointed to the importance of targeting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, Mcl-1 (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Willis et al., 2005</xref>). Mcl-1 overexpression has been reported in breast cancer cells and has been linked with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients and resistance to drug-mediated apoptosis induction (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Booy et al., 2011</xref>). The MAP kinase signaling pathway, which plays an important role in breast cancer progression, has been shown to regulate Mcl-1 expression (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2000</xref>). MAP kinase activation increases Mcl-1 expression leading to cell survival, implicating the role of Mcl-1 in apoptotic cancer cell evasion and breast cancer therapeutic resistance (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Cook, 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>Plant-derived natural products are an important source of compounds with medicinal potential, often serving as drug leads (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Atanasov et al., 2015</xref>). 3-Chloroplumbagin (ChPL) is a naphthoquinone present in plants from the Droseraceae and Plumbaginaceae families (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Sidhu and Sankaram, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Krychowiak et al., 2014</xref>). ChPL is a derivative of plumbagin (PL), a naphthoquinone with anti-proliferative activity toward various cancer cell lines (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kawiak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Aziz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Shieh et al., 2010</xref>), including breast cancer (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Manu et al., 2011</xref>). Our previous research revealed the ability of plumbagin to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells and sensitize breast cancer to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis induction (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kawiak et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kawiak et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have demonstrated the potential of plumbagin to inhibit tumor growth in mice (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al., 2006</xref>). Plumbagin has been shown to induce apoptosis through the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, and among them, Mcl-1 was found to be downregulated by PL in leukemia cells (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kawiak et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gaascht et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies have investigated plumbagin as a lead compound in the development of derivatives with higher therapeutic properties (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Dandawate et al., 2014</xref>). The present research focuses on examining the activity of a 3-chloro derivative of plumbagin and is the first report on the anti-proliferative properties of this compound. The ability of ChPL to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells was examined and the mechanism of ChPL-induced cell death was investigated.</p>

        <title>ChPL Inhibits the Proliferation of Breast Cancer Cells</title>
        <p>The effects of ChPL on MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation were determined with the use of the MTT assay over a period over 24 to 72 h. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of ChPL after 24 h was 1.2 and 3.7&#x2009;&#xB5;M for MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. After a further 24 h of incubation, the IC<sub>50</sub> values decreased to 0.6 and 2&#x2009;&#xB5;M, for MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for ChPL did not decrease significantly with further incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). Further analysis was performed to compare the anti-proliferative activity of plumbagin and its 3-chloro-derviative. The effects of ChPL and PL on the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells were analyzed after a 72-h incubation. Data analysis revealed that after this period, the IC<sub>50</sub> value of plumbagin was comparable to that of ChPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> values for MDA-MB-468 cells were 0.6 and 0.4&#x2009;&#xB5;M for ChPL and PL, respectively, and 2 and 1.8&#x2009;&#xB5;M for ChPL and PL for MCF7 cells, respectively. Furthermore, the anti-proliferative activity of both compounds was analyzed toward a control, immortalized breast epithelial cell line, MCF 10A. ChPL displayed significantly lower cytotoxicity toward MCF 10A cells than PL. At the highest examined concentration of 10&#x2009;&#xB5;M, plumbagin decreased cell viability by 46% after a 72-h incubation period, whereas at this time point, the viability of ChPL-treated cells was 82% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>).</p>

        <p>To determine the mode of cell death induced by ChPL in breast cancer cells, characteristic features of apoptotic cell death were examined. Phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase induction were determined in ChPL-treated MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells. Cytometric analysis of caspase activation revealed a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis induction in both cell lines after a 12-h treatment with ChPL. Similarly to the results of cell viability determination, the MDA-MB-468 cells were more sensitive to ChPL-induced cell death. At the concentration of 1&#x2009;&#xB5;M, a 25% increase in caspase activation was observed and at 5&#x2009;&#xB5;M, caspase induction increased by around 55%. In the case of MCF-7 cells, a 13% and 30% increase in caspase activity induction was observed at the ChPL concentration of 1&#x2009;&#xB5;M and 5&#x2009;&#xB5;M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). In accordance with caspase induction, ChPL also induced phosphatidylserine externalization in breast cancer cells, as analyzed by Annexin V staining. Cytometric analysis of MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells treated with ChPL for a period of 24 h revealed cells mainly in the late-apoptotic stage. At the concentrations of 1 and 5&#x2009;&#xB5;M, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased by 30% and 60% in MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively, whereas in MCF-7 cells at these concentrations, a 10% and 40% increase in apoptotic cell populations were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>).</p>

        <p>Since naphthoquinones have previously been reported to induce apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated pathway, the involvement of the Bcl-2 family proteins in ChPL-induced cell death was further examined. MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells were treated for 24 h with ChPL, and the levels of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins were determined with Western blot analysis. The results showed that the levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 decreased upon ChPL treatment in both cell lines. A significant decrease in Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 levels was observed in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells at the lowest concentrations tested. Furthermore, ChPL increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells. In accordance with the results of the anti-apoptotic proteins, the lowest examined concentrations of ChPL significantly increased pro-apoptotic protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">

        <title>ChPL<bold> Inhibits MAPK Signaling in Breast Cancer Cells</bold>
</title>
        <p>To determine the effects of ChPL on MAPK signaling in breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells were treated with ChPL and Western blot analysis was performed to examine the effects of ChPL on levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK in breast cancer cells. Cells were pretreated for 24 h with plumbagin after which the levels of p-ERK and p-MEK were stimulated with EGF for 30&#x2009;min. The results of Western blot analysis revealed that ChPL reduces the levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK, induced by EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">
<bold>Figure 4A</bold>
</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
<bold>Supplementary Figure 3 and 4</bold>
</xref>). The results obtained with Western blot analysis were confirmed with quantitative AlphaScreen assay analysis of the influence of ChPL on p-ERK inhibition. The AlphaScreen assay is a proximity-based assay employing streptavidin-coated beads conjugated with a biotinylated peptide substrate and acceptor beads with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Provided that the phosphorylation of the ERK protein occurs, the beads are brought into proximity through the binding of the phosphospecific antibody on the acceptor bead. The excitation of donor beads induces the release of singlet oxygen molecules that triggers a cascade of energy transfer in the acceptor beads that results in light emission. To determine the effects of ChPL on p-ERK inhibition, cells were pretreated for 1 h with ChPL after which p-ERK was induced with EGF for 30 min. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">
<bold>Figure 4B</bold>
</xref>, the relative levels of endogenous phosphorylated ERK at residues Thr202 and Tyr 204 were induced with EGF stimulation in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells. The treatment of cells with ChPL markedly reduced the levels of EGF-induced p-ERK, and at the concentrations of 0.2&#x2009;&#xB5;M and 1&#x2009;&#xB5;M a significant reduction in the levels p-ERK were detected in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">

Cells were pretreated for 1&#x2009;h with ChPL and/or AG1478, after which p-ERK was induced with EGF for 30&#x2009;min. The results of the Alpha Screen assay showed a significant reduction in p-ERK in cells pre-treated with a combination of ChPL and AG1478 in comparison to cells treated with single agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 protein family, which participates in regulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (IAP) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2004</xref>). The intrinsic pathway is characterized by mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) which results in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol where it takes part in caspase activation. The MOMP is regulated by Bcl-2 family effectors (Bax and Bak) which heterodimerize creating pores in the outer mitochondria membrane. Bak is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane whereas Bax transfers from the cytosol to the mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. The ability of Bax and Bak to interact is determined by conformational changes induced through interactions with pro-apoptotic, BH3-only Bcl-2 proteins (Bad, Bid, Bim, Puma, Noxa). MOMP is prevented by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins comprising two groups, one consisting of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and the other of Mcl-1 and Bcl2A1, which bind pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins preventing MOMP. Thus, the ratio of apoptotic to anti-apoptotic proteins is critical in regulating cellular susceptibility to apoptosis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cory and Adams, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams and Cory, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Youle and Strasser, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Bcl-2 family protein expression is regulated through various signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase pathway. MAP kinase signaling plays a significant role in breast cancer progression (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2000</xref>). The activation of the MAP kinase pathway has been shown to suppress apoptosis induction through the regulation of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein activity (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Boucher et al., 2000</xref>). ERK activation has been demonstrated to inactivate the pro-apoptotic protein BAD through the phosphorylation at Ser112 by ERK-activated p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bonni et al., 1999</xref>). ERK has also been shown to increase cell survival through enhancing the stability and anti-apoptotic activity of Mcl-1 through phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at Thr163 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Domina et al., 2004</xref>). Research has shown that MAP kinase signaling is involved in the regulation of Mcl-1 transcription (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). The induction of MAPK signaling through EGF stimulation up-regulated Mcl-1 in breast cancer cells. On the other hand, the use of a MAP kinase inhibitor U0126 protected breast cancer cells from EGF-induced Mcl-1 overexpression (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Booy et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, the present research showed that the knockdown of ERK in breast cancer cells decreased Mcl-1 expression and increased the induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the downregulation of ERK expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to ChPL-induced apoptosis induction. Accordingly, ChPL was shown to inhibit MAP kinase signaling and downregulate Mcl-1 expression. The downregulation of Mcl-1 by ChPL was associated with MAPK inhibition as shown by the enhanced ChPL-induced Mcl-1 downregulation in cells with silenced ERK.</p>
      <p>The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are well-recognized drug targets and several Bcl-2 protein inhibitors have been synthesized and some have entered clinical trials (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Doi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hamdy et al., 2013</xref>). Most inhibitor design studies have mainly focused on the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. However, several studies have shown the Mcl-1 protein to be an important target in drug design. The most effective Bcl-2 inhibitors ABT-737 and its analog ABT-263 target Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Oltersdorf et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yip and Reed, 2008</xref>); however, only weakly inhibited Mcl-1 thus are not effective against cancers with elevated Mcl-1 levels (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">van Delft et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, resistance acquired toward ABT-737 and ABT-263 has been shown to be associated with the up-regulation of Mcl-1 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yecies et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The downregulation of Mcl-1 sensitized cells to ABT-737, thus showing that combined therapy with Mcl-1 inhibitors could increase therapy efficacy (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Konopleva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study, the ability of ChPL to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells through the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway was shown. Apoptosis induction by ChPL was associated with the downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. The compensatory nature of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins points to the importance of targeting both subgroups of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to achieve long-term treatment efficacy (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Vogler et al., 2009</xref>). The importance of targeting Mcl-1 in breast cancers is supported by studies carried out on Bcl-2 family proteins examining their upregulation in various types of breast cancers. Mcl-1 upregulation has been determined in 28% of human breast cancer cell lines as reported by the cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE), whereas Bcl-2 is upregulated in 3% (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Cook, 2015</xref>). In triple negative breast cancers following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, <italic>MCL1</italic> expression was amplified in 54% of the examined samples (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Balko et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, irrespective of tumor type, Mcl-1 upregulation has been associated with high tumor grade and a decrease in patient survival (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2007</xref>). Research showing that Mcl-1 upregulation significantly contributes to resistance against widely used anticancer therapies including antitubulins (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wertz et al., 2011</xref>), HER2-targeting agents (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bashari et al., 2016</xref>), points to Mcl-1 as an important target in breast cancer therapy.</p>
      <p>The results of the research presented herein show that ChPL induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through MAP kinase signaling inhibition and activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway involving Mcl-1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
<bold>Figure 6</bold>
</xref>). The activity of ChPL was comparable to that of its precursor, plumbagin. PL is an extensively researched naphthoquinone with promising anti-cancer potential. Plumbagin has been reported to selectively inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells and suppress breast tumor xenograft growth in mice (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al., 2006</xref>). In the present research, ChPL displayed similar activity toward breast cancer cells as plumbagin. The therapeutic potential of ChPL can be emphasized by the lower cytotoxicity of ChPL toward non-tumorigenic, epithelial MCF 10A cells in comparison to plumbagin. Furthermore, in the presented research, ChPL displayed higher activity toward triple negative breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-468, which is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. Since the expression of <italic>MCL-1</italic> in triple negative breast cancer is high, the ability of ChPL to decrease Mcl-1 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells points to its promising potential in breast cancer treatment. Moreover, ChPL inhibited both the Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 arm of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, which is important in minimizing drug resistance occurrence. These findings encourage further investigation into the anticancer potential of ChPL, specifically toward breast cancer cells.</p>
