In all, we identified that elevated circulatory metabolite stearic acid increased lactate levels in the plasma and chondrocytes in a LDH-a-dependent manner. The stearic acid stimulated VEGF and proinflammatory cytokine production through a canonic TLR4 pathway and a novel lactate/HIF1alpha pathway (Fig. 8). The molecules in both pathways might be potential diagnostic markers and functional therapeutic targets.
