The results showed that ChPL inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway through down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. The induction of apoptosis by ChPL was found to be mediated through MAP kinase signaling inhibition. ChPL inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK proteins in breast cancer cells, and increased apoptosis induction in cells with reduced ERK expression. Furthermore, ERK silencing decreased the expression of Mcl-1 in ChPL-treated cells. The results of this research indicate that ChPL induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through MAPK-mediated Mcl-1 inhibition,
