we used a strain expressing the functional KRI-1::GFP protein to examine whether dlc-1 could regulate the expression or localisation of KRI-1. We treated KRI-1::GFP animals with dlc-1 RNAi for 3 days and scored the expression of GFP compared with animals grown on control RNAi. Our results show that dlc-1 RNAi increases the expression of KRI-1::GFP on average with 57% (Figure 5d), demonstrating that dlc-1 can regulate KRI-1. We did not observe any change in localisation of KRI-1::GFP because of RNAi against dlc-1 (Supplementary Figure S9). To test the possibility that DLC-1 and KRI-1 might interact directly, we expressed C. elegans DLC-1 and KRI-1 in a mammalian two-hybrid system using luciferase as readout. As DLC-1 is known to bind to itself in mammalian cells, we used this interaction as a positive control (Figure 5e). However, we did not observe any interaction between DLC-1 and KRI-1 (Figure 5f). Based upon our results we propose that DLC-1 is regulating KRI-1 in response to IR-induced apoptosis to mediate a pro-apoptotic signal from somatic cells to germ cells (Figure 6).
