In the current study, we proved that hypoxic environment promoted KF migration by activating HIF-1alpha-induced EMT. Metformin inhibits hypoxia-induced EMT of KFs via the HIF-1alpha/PKM2 signaling pathway (Figure 5). Based on these data, we propose that the HIF-1alpha/PKM2 pathway is involved in hypoxia-induced EMT in keloids.
