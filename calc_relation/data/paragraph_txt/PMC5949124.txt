The Hh signaling pathway is important in embryonic development, differentiation, proliferation, and maintenance of some adult tissues. Ligands of this pathway in mammals include Sonic, Indian, and Desert. In the absence of these ligands, the transmembrane receptor ptch inhibits another transmembrane protein (smoothened [SMO]), resulting in deactivation of Hh pathway. By binding ligands to the ptch receptor, the inhibitory effect of patch is eliminated from SMO, and SMO activates the downstream transcription factors, including GLI (GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3) proteins. Then GLI translocates to the nucleus and activates Hh-related target genes (Fig. 1).
