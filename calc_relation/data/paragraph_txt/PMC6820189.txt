There are 2 forms of activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway: nonligand dependent and ligand dependent. The activation of nonligand-dependent Hedgehog signaling pathway is the classical activation mode of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is realized by the loss of PTCH1, the activation of SMO, or the activation of Gli and plays an important role in the formation of tumors. Whether the ligand-dependent activation mode is the main factor driving cancer growth has not been clarified. However, it was found in the xenograft mouse model of human tumors that Hedgehog signaling pathway is overactivated with the increase in HH ligand secretion, whether from autocrine of tumor cells or paracrine of surrounding matrix (autocrine/paracrine regulatory mechanisms; Figures 1 and 2)
