OPG is an OC inhibitor that blocks binding of RANKL and the receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK), as well as inhibiting differentiation and maturation of OCs and inducing OCs apoptosis. However, there has been no specific research on the role of OPG in vascular regeneration during osteogenesis. OPG has a functional effect on EPCs, and EPCs are specific hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from bone marrow. These cells are immature endothelial cells that can be mobilized into the peripheral circulating blood by bone marrow mobilization. Differentiation into endotheliocytes is an important functional characteristic of EPCs, and they can also migrate, adhere, and form tubules. EPCs have an important physiological role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and regulating angiogenesis. OPG has long been considered as a critical factor in regulating osteoclast function and bone density alterations. Previous studies demonstrated that OPG improved osteosarcoma and osteoporosis through modulating osteoclast activity. Moreover, some studies have found that OPG may play a potential role in endothelial cell phenotype in angiogenesis. However, the specific therapeutic effect and mechanism of OPG in bone defect repair and angiogenesis have rarely been reported. Based on the unpredictability of OPG in the treatment of bone defects, we performed the above experiments and confirmed that OPG promoted the migration and proliferation of human EPCs, and accelerated angiogenesis and collagenation in a rat bone defect model by independently upregulating the CXCR4 pathway. Therefore, OPG ameliorated healing at the defect site in rats (Figure 5).
