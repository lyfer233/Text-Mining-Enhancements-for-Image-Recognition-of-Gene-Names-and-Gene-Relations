We found that PMA can induce Activin A expression (Figure 6C and 6D). This observation should not be restricted to K562 cells, because Activin A was up-regulated in CHRF-288-11, another megakaryocytic cell line, upon PMA treatment. Activin A was required for PMA-induced SnoN turnover and CD61 induction (Figure 7), indicating that like TGFbeta, Activin A can trigger SnoN proteolysis via the ubiquitin and proteasome pathway. The induction of Activin A was a very quick and persistent process. This may explain why SnoN degradation was maintained at least four days after PMA treatment (Figure 3A), although TGFbeta-induced SnoN turnover is often a transient event. Our data also show that PMA can up-regulate the expression of both Alk4 and ACVR2A (Figure 6), two receptors of Activin A. Consequently, the Smad2 signaling pathway was activated through phosphorylation. The phosphorylated Smad2 was then translocated into the nucleus where it triggered SnoN ubiquitination and degradation by the APC/CCdh1 ubiquitin ligase and the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, we found that the SnoN degradation via the ubiquitin and proteasome pathway is important for CD61 induction. In summary, PMA induces SnoN proteolysis and CD61 expression through an autocrine mechanism (Figure 8).
