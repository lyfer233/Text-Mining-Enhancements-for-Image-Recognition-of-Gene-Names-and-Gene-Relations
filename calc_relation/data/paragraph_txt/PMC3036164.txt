Our data shows for the first time that endodermally expressed Alcama is required for differentiation of NC and ventral pharyngeal cartilage morphogenesis. The alcama-deficient cartilage defect resembles that seen in edn1-class of mutants. In addition, edn1 regulates Alcama protein levels in the pharyngeal endoderm. Moreover, similarly to genes involved in Edn1 signaling, alcama is dispensible for NC patterning and migration, but is required for NC differentiation. Additionally, alcama over-expression partially rescues the NC differentiation defect in edn1-/- mutants, indicating that Alcama mediates Edn1 signaling to NC. Finally, we identify that Nadl1.1, an interacting partner of Alcama, is crucial for transmitting Alcama differentiation signal to NC and promoting ventral cartilage morphogenesis. These data lead us to propose a model (Fig. 8), whereby Edn1 signaling turns on dlx genes in the NC by two independent pathways. Edn1 binds to its receptor on NC to activate NC genes directly. In parallel, Edn1 binds to its receptor on the endoderm to stabilize Alcama protein, which in turn binds to Nadl1.1 on NC and further activates NC genes. Activation of both pathways is required for normal differentiation of NC and cartilage morphogenesis. Zebrafish edn1-/-and plcbeta3-/- mutants have more severe ventral cartilage reductions and joint fusions than alcama morphants. The milder cartilage defect in alcama morphants correlates with the less pronounced reduction of dlx, hand2 and bapx1 gene expression in NC. We propose that this milder defect is due to two concomitant, additive pathways for edn1 signaling; the first acts directly in the NC through the Edn1 receptor and the second activates Alcama signaling from the endoderm to the NC (Fig. 8). While both pathways are affected in edn1 and plcbeta3 mutants, in alcama morphants direct signaling from the Edn1 receptor is still intact and can partially activate dlx gene expression in the NC, resulting in a milder phenotype.
