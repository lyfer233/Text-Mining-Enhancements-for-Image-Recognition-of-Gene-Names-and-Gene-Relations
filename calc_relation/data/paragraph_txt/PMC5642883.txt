TPA has been long used as a carcinogenesis promoting agent in various models. Our previous study found that TPA could induce immortalization of esophageal epithelial cells (SHEEs) into cancer cells (SHEECs). During this progression, the LCN2 gene is upregulated, indicating the LCN2 expression could be induced by TPA. We further showed that LCN2 gene could be induced by TPA and might contain a novel TPA-responsive element (TRE) in -152~-60 bp of its promoter. Five nucleoproteins MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXRbeta were identified by oligonucleotide trapping, as the binding factors on the TRE under TPA stimulation, and were expressed at varying expression levels in esophageal cancer. However, the signaling pathways that participate in these events are poorly understood. In this study, we identify the signal transduction pathway of TPA-induced LCN2 expression in esophageal cancer. MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXRbeta respond to TPA stimulation and enhance the transcriptional expression of LCN2. MEK   ERK, JNK, and p38 were found to regulate the TPA-induced LCN2 expression, especially the MEK   ERK pathway. The previously reported TPA-PKCalpha/beta does not appear to be involved in this process. Our results lead to a model involving MEK   ERK as being the major signaling pathway in TPA-induced LCN2 expression, and MISP, KLF10, KLF15, PPP1R18, and RXRbeta are the nuclear transcription factors that respond to TPA-mediated regulation of LCN2 transcription (Figure 8).
