NOS1 S-nitrosylates PTEN and inhibits autophagy through activating AKT/mTOR pathway in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. A small amount of NO produced by NOS1 selectively modifies PTEN by S-nitrosylation, which is dependent on its interaction with PTEN. This led to activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, the down-regulation of autophagy. In a recent article published in Cell Death Discovery, Zhu et al. have depicted the effect of exogenous NO and endogenous NO on autophagy, and also revealed the molecular mechanism of endogenous NO formed by NOS1 regulate autophagy in cancer cells. We report that NOS1 reduces excessive levels of autophagy and promotes the survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. We found that inhibition of NOS1 increased cell death resulting from siRNA or the use of pharmacologic agents; and this effect was reversed by the autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ). The role of NOS1 in the autophagy process depended on the activation of AKT/mTOR signaling by S-nitrosylation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) proteins (Fig. 1). The mechanism by which NOS1 modifies PTEN protein might involve a direct interaction between these two molecules. Moreover, in an in vivo study, the NOS1 inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) activated AKT/mTOR signaling and promoted autophagy in xenograph tumors.
