In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that MUC4 regulates lipocalin 2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells as it stabilizes HER2 that activates the downstream PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB pathway (Fig. 6). The clinic-pathological studies suggested lipocalin 2 may be a potential biomarker for PC. These results emphasize that mucin covering are not inert layers but active sensors of extracellular environmental changes. Further molecular analyses of their downstream pathway could be expected to identify better disease predictors.
