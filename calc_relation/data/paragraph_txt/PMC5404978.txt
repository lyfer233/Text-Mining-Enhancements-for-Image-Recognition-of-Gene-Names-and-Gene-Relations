We propose the following model for EtOH-induced autophagy in myoblasts based on data from the current study and the published literature (Fig. 10). EtOH-induced changes in LC3B lipidation, SQSTM1 and ATG7 are regulated by FoxO1-AMPK either directly by affecting the PIK3C3 complex, or indirectly via ULK1 and PIK3C3 complex cascades. This, in turn, is mediated by both mTORC1-independent and-dependent pathways. AMPK increases ULK1 function through direct phosphorylation of the S555 residue. Alternatively, AMPK can regulate ULK1 by inactivating mTORC1 through phosphorylation of TSC2 and raptor. Inhibition of mTORC1 is correlated with a decreased ULK1 S757 phosphorylation and increased activity. Regardless, AMPK enhances the activity of ULK1 to regulate its downstream targets BECN1 and PIK3C3. Phosphorylation of BECN1 serves to recruit ATG14 and AMBRA1 for the formation of the pro-autophagy complex that may play an important role in autophagosome formation. Phosphorylation of PIK3C3 appears to be involved in inhibition of the non-autophagy complex. Hence, our data provide greater insight into the molecular mechanisms by which EtOH regulates muscle protein homeostasis.
