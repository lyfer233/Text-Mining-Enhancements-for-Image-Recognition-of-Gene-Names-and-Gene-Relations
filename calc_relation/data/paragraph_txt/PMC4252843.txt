An alternative method for activation of surface MMPs and subsequent release of a tethered ligand may be through G protein-coupled receptor activation. These receptors are coupled to Galphai/ Galphaq and Gbetagamma proteins. Pre-incubation with the Galphai inhibitor, pertussis toxin, resulted in inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation in response to CTF, while the Galphaq inhibitor, GP-2A, had no effect [Figure 4A and 4B]. The activation of EGFR by EGF was unaffected by these inhibitors [Figure 4A and 4C]. Pre-incubation with betaARKCT, a peptide that functions as a Gbetagamma protein inhibitor, resulted in a decreased EGFR phosphorylation in response to CTF [Figure 4A and 4B]. Many GPCRs utilize intracellular calcium, src, PKC and oxygen free radical generation to induce HB-EGF release and EGFR phosphorylation. Inhibition of intracellular calcium or src but not PKC blocked EGFR activation in response to CTF [Figure 4D and 4E]. The activation of EGFR by EGF was unaffected by these inhibitors [Figure 4D and 4F]. Inhibition of oxygen free radical production through either the general inhibitor NAC and the more specific inhibitors DPI and apocynin also decreased EGFR activation in response to CTF but not in response to EGF [Figure 4G and 4H]. The proposed pathway defined by these experiments is shown in Figure 5.
