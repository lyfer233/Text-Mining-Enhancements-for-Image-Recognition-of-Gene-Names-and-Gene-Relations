PKC is a family of serine/threonine kinases that has many different isotypes. The classical PKCalpha isoform in ECs, which contains calcium-binding domains, has an important role in pulmonary edema. Our study suggests that 18% cyclic stretching and large tidal volume ventilation induced PKCalpha expression in in vitro and in vivo models. PKCalpha are activated by signals such as increased cytosolic Ca2+. We found that PKCalpha expression was reduced after BTP2 pretreatment. Possibly because of decreasing Ca2+, PKCalpha was not activated. Activation of PKCalpha is accompanied by translocation to the plasma membrane; unfortunately, we did not examine PKCalpha translocation. We speculate that Stim1/Orai1 regulates vascular permeability via the calcium-sensitive PKCalpha signaling pathway (Figure 8). However, further study is needed to verify that activated PKCalpha not only depends on increase of expression, but also on increase of function.
