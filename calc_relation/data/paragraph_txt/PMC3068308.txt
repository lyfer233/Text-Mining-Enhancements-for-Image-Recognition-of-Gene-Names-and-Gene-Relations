There are three major mitogen activated phosphorylated kinases (MAPK): extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. All MAPK signaling pathways consist of the same basic kinase components. Stimulation of an upstream MAP2K kinase (MAP3K) by growth factors, stress, or other extracellular signals leads to phosphorylation of a MAPK kinase (MAP2K), culminating in the phosphorylation of a terminal MAPK (Figure 4).
