Rho GTPases are key regulators of the actin network. ITSN-L isoforms act as GEFs for Cdc42, which induces the formation of actin-rich surface protrusions called filopodia to regulate cell polarity and actin cytoskeleton. One of the effectors of Cdc42 that allows filopodia formation is the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and its variant N-WASP which are expressed in hematopoietic cells and ubiquitously, respectively. Both proteins are ITSN binding partners, that also interact with WIP (WASP interacting protein), a widely expressed actin-binding protein that regulates stability, location and function of WASP and N-WASP (Figure 2). WIP participates in cellular signaling, endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton remodeling (reviewed in) and is present in actin-rich membrane protrusions that regulate matrix degradation in cells. Association between ITSN and WIP was first suggested after identifying WIP as a binding partner of ITSN2 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. WIP interacts with ITSN1 and ITSN2 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, interaction between ITSN and N-WASP activates N-WASP, which binds the Arp2/3 (actin-related proteins 2 and 3) complex to stimulate actin filament nucleation and initiate actin polymerization (Figure 2).
