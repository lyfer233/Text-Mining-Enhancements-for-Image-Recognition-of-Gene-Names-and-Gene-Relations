Many studies have demonstrated that flavonoids provide anti-tumorigenic activity; in fact, this observation prompted extensive studies that have defined a key role for tumor suppressor proteins and identified new molecular targets for this class of compounds. In this study, we identified NAG-1 and p21 as specific targets for apigenin. Another well-accepted fact obtained during the course of these studies is that apigenin also has p53-dependent and -independent anti-tumorigenic activity (Fig. 6). The overreaching goal of this study was to further characterize a novel molecular pathway identified by our laboratory as a target of apigenin anti-tumorigenic activity with the intention of: 1) substantiating the importance of NAG-1, p21 and p53 as apigenin target genes and 2) identifying this pathway as a target for designing pharmaceutical anti-cancer drugs in the future.
