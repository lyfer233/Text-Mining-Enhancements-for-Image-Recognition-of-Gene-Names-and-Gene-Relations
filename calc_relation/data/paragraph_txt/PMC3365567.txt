In discussing inhibitors of Notch, it is important to consider the complex workings of this pathway (summarized in a simplified fashion in Fig. 1). There are four members of the Notch family (Notch-1, -2, -3, and -4), each a single-pass transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain containing epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and an intracellular domain containing RAM, ankyrin, transactivation, and PEST regions. The ligands for Notch are similar but smaller single-pass transmembrane proteins, consisting of three Delta-like proteins (DLL-1, -3, and -4) and two Jagged proteins (JAG-1 and -2). Other ligands have been proposed, such as the NOV (nephroblastoma-overexpressed) and F3/contactin genes, but they have not been as well-established as Delta-like and Jagged. Binding to Notch by ligand on an adjacent cell triggers two enzymatic cleavages of Notch, extracellularly by an alpha-secretase (a disintegrin and metalloprotease ADAM-10 and ADAM-17) and intracellularly by the gamma-secretase/presenilin complex. The liberated Notch intracellular domain (NICD) then travels to the nucleus, displaces corepressors from CSL (CBF1/Suppressor of hairless/LAG-1) transcription factors, and recruits coactivators such as histone acetyl-transferase and Mastermind-like. In humans, CBF1 is the only CSL factor identified to date. Its targets include the Hes and Hey family of transcription factors, c-myc, NF-kappaB2, p21, and many others yet to be discovered. Up-regulating the transcription of numerous transcription factors enables Notch activation to trigger a cascade of actions and potent effects in the cell.
