We propose two pathways for the inhibition of neural differentiation by RhoA (Fig. 8). The first is transcriptional, consisting of connections between RhoA and downstream target genes implicated in neural differentiation: SIRT1, RARgamma, and, further downstream, SMAD1 and Noggin. The inhibition of RARgamma suppresses neural differentiation because of the concomitant decrease in Noggin expression, thus allowing BMP4 to bind to BMPRs. The mechanism by which RARgamma increases Noggin production is unknown. Published data suggest that RARgamma could increase Noggin expression by associating with a large transcription factor complex that includes Myc, for which there are binding sites in the 5' promoter region of Noggin.
