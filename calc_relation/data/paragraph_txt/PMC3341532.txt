Based on the findings described above, we propose a model, outlined in Fig. 8, for the role of PPARdelta in modulating radiation-induced proinflammatory responses in microglia. Following irradiation, increased intracellular ROS generation leads to activation of the stress-activated kinases, PKCalpha, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, and the proinflammatory transcription factors, NF-kappaB and AP-1. Activation of these transcription factors increases the expression of Cox-2, MCP-1, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha; these proinflammatory mediators contribute to the inflammatory phenotype of microglia. PPARdelta activation prevents the radiation-induced proinflammatory response, in part, by negatively regulating NF-kappaB and AP-1. Specifically, PPARdelta physically interacts with p65 and inhibits the DNA binding of NF-kappaB. Futhermore, PPARdelta inhibits the radiation-induced increase in intracellular ROS generation, which prevents PKCalpha, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and c-jun phosphorylation and the DNA binding of AP-1. Taken together, our data indicate that PPARdelta activation can prevent the acute radiation-induced oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses observed in microglia within hours of in vitro irradiation.
