Model to depict functional coupling between Stim1- and Orai1-mediating calcium entry. Stim1/Orai1-mediated calcium entry is critical for endothelial permeability via activation of calcium-sensitive PKCalpha. Within these ER-PM junctions, Ca2+ enters via Orai1 (the PM Ca2+ entry channel), where the channel interacts with Stim1 (the ER luminal Ca2+ sensor), and is activated. Ca2+ entry through Orai1 channel induces multiple signaling pathways such as activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. The classical PKCalpha isoforms contains both calcium- and diacylglycerol-binding domains, and activation of PKCalpha is accompanied by translocation to the plasma membrane. ER - endoplasmic reticulum; PM - plasmic membrane; DAG - diacylglycerol.
