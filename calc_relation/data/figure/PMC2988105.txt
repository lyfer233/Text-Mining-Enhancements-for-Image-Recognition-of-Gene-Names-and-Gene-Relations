Mechanism by which apigenin induces apoptosis and suppresses cell growth in HCT-116 cells. Apigenin affects the PKCdelta pathway to increase p21 and NAG-1 expressions, followed by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. Phosphor-p53 at Ser-37 and Ser-15, which are active forms, were increased by apigenin through the ATM pathway. Overall, apigenin affects p21 and NAG-1 expression in a p53- independent pathway.
