Mechanisms by which HER3 contributes to resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy. (a) The oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase MET could phosphorylate HER3, leading to activation of the PI3 K/Akt pathway independent of EGFR kinase activity. (b) Lengthy exposure of cancer cells to TKIs can lead to Akt downregulation which consequently increases HER3 translocation from the cytoplasm to the membrane through a feedback regulation. The phosphorylation of HER3 recruits PI3 K and further activates the PI3 K/Akt pathway which plays an important role in resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy.
