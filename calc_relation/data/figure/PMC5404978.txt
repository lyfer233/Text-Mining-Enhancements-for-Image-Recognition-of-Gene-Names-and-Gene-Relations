Proposed model for FoxO1 and AMPK regulation of EtOH-induced autophagy. EtOH increases LC3B lipidation and decreases SQSTM1, with this process being mediated via multiple signaling cascades. EtOH stimulates FoxO1 activity, which increases the phosphorylation and function of AMPK. Upon activation, the PIK3C3 complex can be directly regulated by AMPK through phosphorylation of BECN1 (S93, S14) and PIK3C3 (S164). Alternatively, AMPK can affect ULK1 function to regulate its downstream target PIK3C3 complex through phosphorylation of BECN1 and PIK3C3 via a mTORC1-independent and dependent pathway. The activated PIK3C3 complex increases LC3B-II and ATG7 levels, as well as decreases SQSTM1.
