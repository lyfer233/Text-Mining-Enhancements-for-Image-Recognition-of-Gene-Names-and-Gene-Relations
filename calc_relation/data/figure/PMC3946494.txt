Proposed model of MUC4-mediated regulation of lipocalin 2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells. MUC4 stabilizes HER2, leading to the PI3K-dependent activation of AKT and activated AKT enhances the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit. The lipocalin 2 promoter has an NF-kappaB-binding site; activated NF-kappaB induces lipocalin 2 transcription in pancreatic cancer cells. Thus, MUC4-mediated activation of NF-kappaB via the HER2/PI3K/AKT pathway leads to elevated expression of lipocalin 2 during pancreatic cancer progression.
