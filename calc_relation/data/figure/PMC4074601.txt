Model of PMA-induced SnoN turnover and CD61 expression. PMA stimulates expression of Activin A which activates Smad2 signaling pathway via activating its receptors, such as Alk4. Phosphorylated Smad2 functions as a cofactor for the APCCdh1 ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate SnoN. SnoN functions as an inhibitor of CD61 expression and its proteolysis via the ubiquitin and proteasome pathway is important for PMA-induced CD61 induction.
