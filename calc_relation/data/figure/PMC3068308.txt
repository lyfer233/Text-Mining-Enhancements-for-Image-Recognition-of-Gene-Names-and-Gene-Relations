MAPkinase signalling. Mitogen-activated phosphorylated kinase signaling occurs through a common pathway. A cellular stimulus results in phosphorylation of MAP3K, which in turn phosphorylates MAP2K. MAP2K subsequently phosphorylates MAPK, resulting in altered transcription of the MAPK target genes. The different components of the two MAPK signaling pathways often affected in PDAC, the ERK pathway and the JNK pathway, are depicted in the boxes on each side of the signaling cascade.
