Representative pathway for CTF transmembrane signaling. CTF interacts with a G protein-coupled receptor which activates activates both Galphai and Gbetagamma. In turn, a series of intracellular molecules are involved which lead to activation of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase Domains (ADAM) proteases (ADAM-10 and ADAM-12). Activation of ADAM-associated MMP activity leads to release of the tethered ligand, HB-EGF, which in turn activates the EGFR. Activation of EGFR is necessary for CTF-mediated proliferation.
