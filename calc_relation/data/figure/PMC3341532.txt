Proposed model outlining the role of PPARdelta in the modulation of the radiation-induced proinflammatory response in BV-2 cells.  Irradiation of BV-2 cells leads to an increase in intracellular ROS generation. This increases activation of the stress-activated kinases, PKCalpha, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, and the proinflammatory transcription factors, NF-kappaB and AP-1. Activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 enhance the expression of Cox-2, MCP-1, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha. PPARdelta activation prevents radiation-induced neuroinflammation, in part, by transrepression of NF-kappaB by physical interaction with the p65 subunit. Additionally, PPARdelta inhibits intracellular ROS generation, which prevents PKCalpha, MEK, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and downstream activation of AP-1.
