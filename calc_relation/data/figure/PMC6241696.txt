Mechanistic regulatory network of FSH to cervical cancer, mediated through the PKA-NF-kappaB pathway. Note: After PKA activates FSH, GSK-3beta activity is downregulated, which induces the inactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway to decrease the cell cycle and activate cell apoptosis. Abbreviations: FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; PKA, protein kinase A; GSK-3beta, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; NF-kappaB, nuclear factor-kappa B; CASP3, Caspase 3.
