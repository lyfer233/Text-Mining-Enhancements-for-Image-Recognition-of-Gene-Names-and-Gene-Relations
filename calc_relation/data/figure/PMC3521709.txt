Proteins of the CED-10 Rac pathway are labeled in yellow. Proteins of the CED-1 pathway are labeled in green. C. elegans protein names are indicated above and their mammalian homologs below. The Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC) contains ABI-1, GEX-2, GEX-3, WVE-1 and NUO-3. The dashed arrow from CED-6 to CED-10 indicates that CED-1, CED-6 and CED-7 might also signal through CED-10. The CED-1 pathway is required for engulfment only, whereas the CED-10 Rac pathway is required for both engulfment and DTC migration.
