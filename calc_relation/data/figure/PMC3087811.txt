Schematic model for the role of TGF-beta signaling pathways in iTreg and Th17 cell development. TGF-beta binding induces heteromeric complex formation of TbetaR-II and TbetaR-I. This complex activates SMAD2 or SMAD3, as well as the ERK and JNK MAPKs pathways, which induces Foxp3 expression and drives the development of induced regulatory T cells when IL-2 is present. Conversely, this complex activates STAT3, JNK, and p38 MAPKs, promoting RORgammat-expressing CD4+ cells to differentiate into Th17 cells when IL-6 is present. Foxp3 expression can suppress RORgammat+ cells from conversion to Th17 cells, but IL-6 signaling pathway molecules, such as STAT3 and SMAD7, also have a negative feedback on Foxp3+ induced regulation differentiation.
