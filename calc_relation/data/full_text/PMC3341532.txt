 PPARdelta prevents radiation-induced proinflammatory responses in microglia via transrepression of NF-kappaB and inhibition of the PKCalpha/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway. Partial or whole-brain irradiation is often required to treat both primary and metastatic brain cancer. Radiation-induced normal tissue injury, including progressive cognitive impairment, however, can significantly affect the well-being of the approximately 200,000 patients who receive these treatments each year in the US. Although the exact mechanisms underlying radiation-induced late effects remain unclear, oxidative stress and inflammation are thought to play a critical role. Microglia are key mediators of neuroinflammation. Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)delta has been shown to be a potent regulator of anti-inflammatory responses. Thus, we hypothesized that PPARdelta activation would modulate the radiation-induced inflammatory response in microglia. Incubating BV-2 murine microglial cells with the PPARdelta agonist, L-165041, prevented the radiation-induced increase in: i) intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, ii) Cox-2 and MCP-1 expression, and iii) IL-1beta and TNF-alpha message levels. This occured, in part, through PPARdelta-mediated modulation of stress activated kinases and proinflammatory transcription factors. PPARdelta inhibited NF-kappaB via transrepression by physically interacting with the p65 subunit, and prevented activation of the PKCalpha/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway by inhibiting the radiation-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation. These data support the hypothesis that PPARdelta activation can modulate radiation-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in microglia. Each year, approximately 200,000 patients will receive fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation (fWBI) as treatment for primary or metastatic brain cancer. Unfortunately, the radiation dose that can be delivered to the tumor is limited by the risk of toxicity to the surrounding normal brain tissue. Radiation-induced brain injury can lead to cognitive deficits several months to years after irradiation that affect patients' quality of life (QOL). This diminished QOL has become an important concern for these long-term survivors of brain irradiation, and is recognized as one of the most important measurements of brain tumor therapy outcomes in clinical trials, second only to survival. Although clinical trials have demonstrated that short-term interventions can modulate cognitive impairment, there are no proven long-term treatments for radiation-induced cognitive deficits; therefore, it is important to investigate new therapeutic approaches. Although it was once believed that the brain was not susceptible to inflammation, studies have now demonstrated that inflammatory responses do occur and may contribute to radiation-induced brain injury. In vivo studies indicate that there is an increase in proinflammatory mediators within hours of irradiating the rodent brain. Microglia are considered to be one of the key mediators of neuroinflammation. In an uninjured brain, ramified microglia actively monitor the microenvironment to ensure that the brain is maintaining homeostasis. Following injury, microglia become activated, a process characterized by rounding of the cell body, retraction of cell processes, proliferation, and an increased production of cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although microglial activation plays an important role in phagocytosis of dead cells, sustained activation is thought to contribute to a chronic proinflammatory state in the brain. In vivo studies in rodents indicate that radiation leads to an increase in microglial activation. Irradiating microglia cells in vitro leads to an increase in proinflammatory mediators, such as the cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and the chemokines MCP-1 and ICAM-1. Radiation-induced chronic oxidative stress and inflammatory responses produced by microglia may: i) lead to a decrease in neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a critical region for learning and memory; and/or ii) alter the environment of the neurogenic niche and, in turn, the functions of the pre-existing neurons. Studies in rodents demonstrate that the administration of anti-inflammatory drugs can decrease radiation-induced microglial activation. This decrease has been associated with an improvement in hippocampal neurogenesis. Moreover, administration of eicosapentaenoic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties, restored the altered long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal slices following irradiation of the rat brain. LTP is thought to underlie memory and cognitive function; it is a measure of signal transmission between two neurons. These findings provide a strong rationale for investigating anti-inflammatory therapies to mitigate radiation-induced brain injury. PPARdelta is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors and one of three subtypes (alpha, delta, and gamma) that make up the PPAR family. PPARs regulate transcription by heterodimerizing with the retinoid x receptor (RXR) and binding to PPAR response elements (PPREs). PPREs, located in the enhancer regions of genes, consist of an AGGTCA hexameric direct repeat separated by one or two nucleotides. PPAR subtypes are encoded by different genes, have unique tissue distributions, and exhibit overlapping and differential functions. PPARdelta is thought to be expressed ubiquitously; it is the predominant PPAR subtype in the CNS. Several studies have demonstrated that PPARdelta activation can modulate oxidative stress and inflammatory processes. PPARdelta mediates many of its anti-inflammatory effects by preventing activation of stress-activated kinases and proinflammatory transcription factors. In addition, PPARdelta has been shown to regulate oxidative stress by activating transcription of antioxidant genes, such as catalase and superoxide dismutase. Recent studies suggest that PPARdelta agonists may ameliorate the severity of various acute and chronic CNS pathologies, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, in large part, by modulating the oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses associated with these diseases. The role of PPARdelta in the modulation of radiation-induced brain injury is unknown. We hypothesized that activation of PPARdelta would inhibit the radiation-induced oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses in microglia. Here, we report that PPARdelta activation does indeed prevent the radiation-induced increase in: i) intracellular ROS generation, ii) Cox-2 and MCP-1 protein, and iii) IL-1beta and TNF-alpha message levels. This occurred, in part, by transrepression of NF-kappaB and inhibition of the PKCalpha/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway. Materials and methods. Materials.

Rabbit anti-p-PKCalpha was purchased from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA), and mouse anti-beta-actin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cell culture and Irradiation. BV-2 cells, immortalized murine microglial cells, were cultured in DMEM high glucose media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplied with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and were maintained at 37 C in 10% CO2 and 90% air. Twenty-four hours prior to irradiation, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free media. Cells were irradiated with a single dose of 10 Gy using a 137Cs irradiator (J.L. Shepherd and Associates, San Fernando, CA) at a dose rate of 3.56 Gy/min. Irradiations were conducted at room temperature and control cells received sham-irradiation. Following irradiation, culture dishes were returned to the incubator and maintained at 37 C in 10% CO2 and 90% air. Short hairpin RNA targeting. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were generated as described by Sui et al.. The PPARdelta target site is: GGACCAGAACACACGCTTCCTT. BV-2 cells were infected with ecotropic virus and infected cells were selected by puromycin selection (Sigma-Aldrich). Single-cell clones were generated, and the expression of PPARdelta was evaluated by western blot analysis. Overexpression. BV-2 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1.PPARdelta (Invitrogen) or the pcDNA3.1 empty vector control using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase assay. Cells were plated on 24-well plates; 24 h later, cells were cotransfected with i) 0.2 mug of PPRE-ACOX (PPRE consensus sequence for the rat acyl-CoA oxidase gene, a kind gift from Dr. Thomas McIntyre, Univ. of Utah) or pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and ii) 0.02 mug pRL-SV40 renilla vector (a kind gift from Dr. Lee Yong Woo, Univ. of Virginia). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle control or L-165041. Twenty-four hours later, the Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega) was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the Terner Designs Reporter Microplate Luminometer (Promega) was used to measure luciferase activity. Fold change in luminescence, a measure of luciferase activity, was calculated by the relative luminescence units (RLU) of firefly/RLU renilla luciferase. Measurement of intracellular ROS generation. Intracellular ROS generation was measured using 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH-DA) as previously described. DCFH-DA is permeable to cell membranes; once in cells, it is cleaved by cellular esterases and becomes impermeable. When oxidized by ROS, the probe becomes fluorescent. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS+ (1x PBS supplemented with 0.14 g/L CaCl2 and 0.1 g/L of MgCl2), incubated with 10 muM DCFH-DA (Invitrogen, CA/Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min, washed with PBS+ to remove excess probe, and then incubated with 5 muM L-165041. Three hours after L-165041 treatment, cells were irradiated with a single dose of 10 Gy of 137Cs gamma rays. One hour post-irradiation, ROS generation was measured using a FACS BDCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA), and BD CellQuest  Pro 6.0 software was used to analyze the data. RNA isolation and qRT-PCR Syber Green. RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA contamination was removed by acid-phenol chloroform extraction (pH 4.6, 125:24:1, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Real-time PCR amplifications were conducted in a 25 muL reaction volume containing 1 muL cDNA, 12.5 muL SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 0.1 muM upstream and downstream primers, and 10.5 muL nuclease-free water. Real-time PCR was carried out in an ABI Prism  7000 at 50 C for 2 min, 95 C for 2 min, and 45 cycles of 95 C for 15 min, 55 C for 30 sec, and 72 C for 30 sec. The fold changes in MCP-1, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha gene expression were calculated using the comparative Ct (cross threshold) method. In brief, the Ct of the housekeeping gene GAPDH was subtracted from the Ct of MCP-1, IL-1beta, or TNF-alpha to get DeltaCt. The DeltaCt of the sham-irradiated group was then subtracted from the DeltaCt for each of the other treatment groups to get DeltaDeltaCt. Fold changes compared to the sham-irradiated group were determined by calculating 2-DeltaDeltaCt. Data represent the mean +- S.E.M of three independent experiments. Immunoblotting. Total cellular protein was harvested using M-PER lysis buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL) supplemented with 1 mg/mL aprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mg/mL leupetin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 150 mM of NaCl. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA) at absorbance 595 nm. Five to 50 mug of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for 1.5-3 h at 80 V, blocked in 2.5% BSA in TBST (0.02 M Tris, 0.015 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5), and incubated overnight with primary antibody. Membranes were washed, incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, developed using the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare, NJ), and processed using a Kodak Processing System. Films were scanned and densitometry was conducted to quantify the signal intensity using Adobe Photoshop Elements 6.0. Electromobility shift assay (EMSA). Cells were lysed on ice with Buffer A (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2,10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT); lysates were homogenized using a dounce homogenizer, which was followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. To extract nuclear protein, the nuclear pellets were lysed with Buffer C (5 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25% v/v glycerol, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2 mg/mL aprotinin, 2 mg/mL leupeptin, and 1 mM Na3VO4). This was followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay (BioRad) at absorbance 595 nm. The EMSA procedure was performed using the Promega Gel-Shift Core Assay following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 10 mug of nuclear protein were incubated with 2 muL Binding Buffer (Promega) for 10 min. Consensus binding sequences of NF-kappaB (5'-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3' and 3'TCAACTCCCCTGAAAGGGTCCG-5') and AP-1 (5'-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3' and 3'-GCGAACTACTCAGTCGGCCTT-5') were labeled with 10 muCi gamma-P32 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The consensus sequences were then incubated with the nuclear protein for 20 min and electrophoresed on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. An X-ray film was then placed on top of the gel and developed overnight at -80 C. The X-ray film was processed using a Kodak Processing System. Films were scanned and densitometry was performed. Co-Immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were collected using RIPA buffer (50mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% SDS, 1 mg/mL aprotinin, 1 mg/mL leupetin, 10 mg/mL PMSF, and 1 mM Na3VO4). Lysates were incubated with 2 mug anti-p65 at 4 C for 3 h, and immunocomplexes were captured by incubating lysates with Protein A/G PLUS agarose beads (Santa Cruz) at 4 C overnight. Agarose beads were centrifuged and washed 8 times with RIPA buffer. After centrifugation, the pellet was diluted with 80 mul 4x SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.25M Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 30% Glycerol, 0.02% Bromophenol Blue, and 10% B-ME), and boiled for 5 min. The samples were then subjected to electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with an anti-PPARdelta antibody. Statistical Analysis. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three independent times. All analyses were carried out using SAS software (SAS Inc, Cary, NC). Although the sample size within each treatment group is not large, we believe that the outcome measure distribution is normally distributed in the population. To determine statistical significance between two treatment groups, when appropriate, either a one- (when compared to sham) or two-sample t test was used. If more than two treatment groups were compared, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore the overall association. Bonferroni and Tukey's studentized range tests were used for pairwise comparisons. Levene's test was used to examine the homogeneity of variance, an assumption of variance. When this assumption was not valid, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Results. BV-2 cells express a functional PPARdelta. To demonstrate that BV-2 cells contain a functional PPARdelta and were appropriate for our studies, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Cells were co-transfected with: i) a PPRE-driven luciferase vector or a pGL3 control vector, and ii) a renilla vector. They were then incubated with the PPARdelta agonist, L-165041, or vehicle control for 24 h, and luciferase activity was measured. Incubating BV-2 cells with 5 muM of L-165041 led to a 2-fold increase in luciferase activity, suggesting that these cells do express a functional PPARdelta (SFig. 1). Since 5 muM of L-165041 led to a significant increase in luciferase fluorescence, we chose to use this concentration of the PPARdelta agonist for the remainder of our studies. PPARdelta activation prevents the radiation-induced increase in intracellular ROS generation and proinflammatory mediators in BV-2 cells. Radiation induces increased intracellular ROS generation in BV-2 cells; we hypothesized that PPARdelta activation could modulate this response. To test this hypothesis, we used the oxidation sensitive probe DCFH-DA to measure intracellular ROS generation in BV-2 cells, which were incubated with L-165041 prior to irradiation with a single dose of 10 Gy. As predicted, irradiating the cells resulted in increased ROS production 1 h post-irradiation, and this response was inhibited in cells treated with L-165041 (Fig. 1A). Incubating the cells with nacetyl-cysteine, an ROS scavenger, also inhibited the radiation-induced increase in DCF fluorescence (Fig. 1A). As expected, the non-oxidizable control probe, carboxy-DCF (C369) did not show any radiation-induced difference in fluorescence (Fig. 1A). Previous reports have demonstrated that irradiating BV-2 cells leads to an increase in Cox-2 protein and IL-1beta and TNF-alpha message levels. We hypothesized that PPARdelta activation would inhibit the radiation-induced inflammatory response in BV-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B (SFig. 2), L-165041 inhibited the increase in Cox-2 and MCP-1 protein levels observed 7 h post-irradiation. The increase in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha message levels determined 24 h post-irradiation was also significantly inhibited when cells were pretreated with L-165041 (Fig. 1C). This effect appeared to be PPARdelta-dependent; L-165041 failed to inhibit the radiation-induced increase in Cox-2 in the presence of the PPARdelta antagonist GSK0660 (SFig. 3). Moreover, overexpressing PPARdelta by transfecting cells with the pcDNA3.1.PPARdelta vector inhibited the radiation-induced increase in Cox-2 expression (Fig. 2A). In contrast, shRNA-mediated knockdown of PPARdelta (Fig. 2B) led to an increase in the radiation-induced Cox-2 and MCP-1 expression compared to cells infected with scrambled control shRNA. These results indicate that: i] overexpression of PPARdelta prevents the radiation-induced increase in Cox-2 expression, and ii] loss of PPARdelta enhances the radiation-induced increase in Cox-2 and MCP-1 expression. We also examined if PPARdelta knockdown leads to an increase in IL-1beta or TNF-alpha message levels, or intracellular ROS generation; however, we did not observe any differences in these endpoints between cells expressing scramble- or PPARdelta-targeted shRNA (data not shown). PPARdelta activation inhibits NF-kappaB activation via transrepression by physically interacting with the p65 subunit. The radiation-induced proinflammatory response in BV-2 cells is regulated, in part, by NF-kappaB. Thus, we examined if PPARdelta activation could modulate NF-kappaB activation in BV-2 cells following irradiation. As predicted, pre-incubating BV-2 cells with L-165041 prevented the radiation-induced increase in NF-kappaB DNA binding observed 30 min post-irradiation (Fig 3A; SFig 4A). To investigate the mechanism by which PPARdelta modulates NF-kappaB activation, we examined the phosphorylation of Ikappa-Balpha and the nuclear translocation of p65. Thirty minutes post-irradiation, we observed the predicted increases in the phosphorylation of Ikappa-Balpha at Ser 32 and the nuclear translocation of p65; L-165041 did not modulate these responses (Figs. 3B & 3C; SFig 4B and SFig 4C). Next, we examined if PPARdelta inhibited NF-kappaB activation via transrepression by binding to the p65 subunit. Indeed, when we immunoprecipitated cellular lysates for p65 and then immunoblotted for PPARdelta, we observed that L-165041 led to an increase in the binding of PPARdelta to p65 30 min post-irradiation (Fig. 3D). Mechanistically, these data suggest that PPARdelta activation prevents the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB via transrepression by physically interacting with the p65 subunit. PPARdelta activation prevents AP-1 activation by inhibiting c-jun phosphorylation and upstream activation of the stress-activated kinases MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. In addition to NF-kappaB activation, activation of AP-1 is thought to underlie the radiation-induced increase in proinflammatory mediators in BV-2 cells. We therefore investigated if L-165041 could also modulate AP-1 activation. Pre-incubating BV-2 cells with L-165041 prevented the radiation-induced increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity observed 30 min post-irradiation (Fig. 4A; SFig. 5A). Activation of AP-1, a dimeric protein, is mediated, in part, by phosphorylation of the c-jun subunit. We observed that L-165041 inhibited the phosphorylation of nuclear c-jun at Ser73 following irradiation, suggesting that PPARdelta activation inhibits AP-1 activation by preventing c-jun activation (Fig. 4B; SFig. 5B). MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activation regulates c-jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation in BV-2 cells [Zhiyong Deng and Weiling Zhao, unpublished data]. Interestingly, studies have demonstrated that PPARdelta can modulate activation of the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, we hypothesized that PPARdelta modulates AP-1 activation via inhibition of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Consistent with our hypothesis, pre-incubating BV-2 cells with L-165041 reduced the radiation-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 at Ser218 and Ser222, and that of ERK1/2 at Thr 202 and Tyr 204 (Figs. 4C & 4D; SFigs. 5C & 5D). Furthermore, pretreating BV-2 cells with 2 muM of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, or 2 muM of the ERK1/2 inhibitor, FR180204, inhibited the radiation-induced increase in intracellular ROS generation and Cox-2 expression (Figs. 5A & 5B; SFigs. 6). MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 inhibition also prevented the radiation-induced increases in MCP-1, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha gene expression (Figs. 6A & 6B). PPARdelta modulates MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activation, in part, by inhibiting the radiation-induced phosphorylation and expression of PKCalpha. PKCalpha is an activator of the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway. A radiation-induced activation of PKCalpha has not been previously reported in microglia. However, lipopolysaccaride (LPS), an inflammatory stimulus, has been shown to increase activation of PKCalpha in microglial cells. Therefore, we next investigated if radiation induces PKCalpha activation in BV-2 cells, and further, if PPARdelta activation can modulate this response. As shown in Fig. 7A (SFig. 7A), irradiating BV-2 cells with a single dose of 10 Gy led to an increase in the phosphorylation of PKCalpha at Thr638 and the expression of PKCalpha, and pre-treatment with L-165041 prevented these increases. To demonstrate that inhibition of PKCalpha prevents the radiation-induced activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, we pre-treated BV-2 cells with 1 muM of the PKCalpha/beta inhibitor, Go6976, and examined the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 30 min post-irradiation. As predicted, Go6976 prevented the radiation-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 (Figs. 7B & 7C; SFigs. 7B & 7C). The radiation-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 is modulated by ROS production in BV-2 cells [Zhiyong Deng and Weiling Zhao, unpublished data]. Our results suggest that PKCalpha regulates MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation; thus, we examined whether PKCalpha phosphorylation is also modulated by ROS production. Indeed, pre-treating BV-2 cells with 10 mM of NAC inhibited the radiation-induced phosphorylation and expression of PKCalpha (Fig. 7D; SFig. 7D). Given that L-165041 inhibited the radiation-induced increase in intracellular ROS generation (Fig. 1A), these data suggest that PPARdelta activation negatively regulates the PKCalpha/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway by preventing ROS generation following irradiation. Discussion. A growing body of evidence suggests that PPARdelta activation can regulate oxidative stress and inflammatory responses following various cellular stresses. We therefore hypothesized that PPARdelta activation would prevent the radiation-induced oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses in microglia. As predicted, pretreating BV-2 cells with L-165041 inhibited the radiation-induced increase in: i) intracellular ROS generation, ii) Cox-2 and MCP-1 protein expression, and iii) IL-1beta and TNF-alpha message levels. This occurred, in part, by negatively regulating the DNA binding of NF-kappaB and AP-1. PPARdelta activation: i) inhibited NF-kappaB via transrepression by physically interacting with the p65 subunit, and ii) prevented activation of the PKCalpha/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway by inhibiting the radiation-induced increase in intracellular ROS generation. The radiation-induced proinflammatory response in BV-2 cells is regulated, in part, by NF-kappaB. There are several mechanisms by which PPARdelta can modulate NF-kappaB, including: i) inhibiting the nuclear translocation of p65, ii) binding directly to p65, and iii) reducing acetylation of p65. In a rat model of reperfusion injury, the PPARdelta agonist, GW0742, reduced myocardial infarct size, in part, by inhibiting nuclear translocation of p65. In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, L-165041 decreased LPS-stimulated NF-kappaB activation by increasing the physical interaction of PPARdelta with the p65 subunit. This interaction is thought to interfere with the DNA binding of NF-kappaB. The PPARdelta agonist, GW501516, inhibited inflammation in human HaCaT keratinocytes by reducing TNF-alpha-induced p65 acetylation. Acetylation of p65 is regulated by the transcriptional co-activator p300; reduced acetylation of p65 decreases DNA binding and activation of NF-kappaB. Our studies indicate that L-165041 increased the physical interaction of PPARdelta to p65, suggesting that the receptor modulates NF-kappaB activation via transrepression. In addition to NF-kappaB activation, the radiation-induced proinflammatory response in BV-2 cells is regulated, in part, by AP-1 activation. The transactivation function of the c-jun subunit of AP-1 depends on the phosphorylation of residues Ser63 and Ser73. Radiation induces phosphorylation of both residues in BV-2 cells. We observed that PPARdelta prevents the phosphorylation of nuclear c-jun at Ser73, and further, inhibits AP-1 DNA binding. Previous studies in BV-2 cells demonstrate that c-jun is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 [Zhiyong Deng and Weiling Zhao, unpublished data]. We observed that PPARdelta activation prevents the radiation-induced activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. In addition to AP-1, activation of the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway has been shown to modulate NF-kappaB activation. In white adipose tissue, PPARdelta activation prevented LPS-induced inflammation by inhibiting ERK1/2 activation and the downstream activation of NF-kappaB. It is therefore possible that the PPARdelta-mediated modulation of the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway in our model also contributes to a reduction in radiation-induced proinflammatory responses, in part, by preventing NF-kappaB activation. PKC is an upstream regulator of the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway. In BV-2 cells, LPS-stimulated PKC activation led to ERK1/2 phosphorylation and increased Cox-2 protein levels. Furthermore, in cultures of primary microglia, LPS-stimulated PKCalpha modulated TNF-alpha expression. Studies have demonstrated that PPARdelta can modulate PKCalpha. In PPARdelta-null mice compared to wild-type mice, TPA induced significantly greater PKCalpha activity, enhancing MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Cox-2 expression. Moreover, studies in platelets have demonstrated that PPARdelta can physically interact with PKCalpha and suppress PKCalpha-mediated platelet activation. Given the evidence that PKCalpha modulates both the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway and inflammation, and further that PPARdelta modulates PKCalpha activity, we examined if PKCalpha was an activator of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in our model. Indeed, we observed that the radiation-induced phosphorylation of PKCalpha activates the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway, and PPARdelta activation inhibits this response. Our data suggest that PPARdelta prevented activation of the PKCalpha/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway by inhibiting the radiation-induced increase in intracellular ROS generation. Of interest, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 inhibition also prevented the radiation-induced increase in intracellular ROS generation, suggesting that the increase in intracellular ROS generation observed following irradiation reflects both direct and indirect effects, and that PPARdelta activation can inhibit these responses. The antioxidant actions of PPARdelta agonists have been observed in a variety of cell types; we observed that PPARdelta activation could inhibit intracellular ROS generation following irradiation of BV-2 cells. It should be noted that PPARdelta can activate transcription of several antioxidant genes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase 1, heme oxygenase 1, and thioredoxin 1. Previous studies in our lab have failed to detect changes in the expression levels of antioxidant genes in BV-2 cells; however, changes in the activity levels of antioxidant enzymes have not been examined. Future studies should examine if radiation induces changes in the activity levels of antioxidant enzymes, and further, if PPARdelta can modulate these changes. These studies will help elucidate the mechanisms by which PPARdelta activation can modulate intracellular ROS. Based on the findings described above, we propose a model, outlined in Fig. 8, for the role of PPARdelta in modulating radiation-induced proinflammatory responses in microglia. Following irradiation, increased intracellular ROS generation leads to activation of the stress-activated kinases, PKCalpha, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, and the proinflammatory transcription factors, NF-kappaB and AP-1. Activation of these transcription factors increases the expression of Cox-2, MCP-1, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha; these proinflammatory mediators contribute to the inflammatory phenotype of microglia. PPARdelta activation prevents the radiation-induced proinflammatory response, in part, by negatively regulating NF-kappaB and AP-1. Specifically, PPARdelta physically interacts with p65 and inhibits the DNA binding of NF-kappaB. Futhermore, PPARdelta inhibits the radiation-induced increase in intracellular ROS generation, which prevents PKCalpha, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and c-jun phosphorylation and the DNA binding of AP-1. Taken together, our data indicate that PPARdelta activation can prevent the acute radiation-induced oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses observed in microglia within hours of in vitro irradiation. It is important to note that the microglia used in our in vitro studies were grown under 21% oxygen, a concentration much higher than would occur in vivo. Thus, the affect of "physiological" oxygen concentration on the radiation-induced inflammatory response of microglial cells remains to be determined. Furthermore, although our in vitro studies examined the radiation-induced inflammatory response in microglial cells, radiation-induced brain injury in vivo is a multicellular process. Indeed, we recognize that interpreting these data in terms of their relevance to the onset and progression of radiation-induced late effects in the brain is difficult and somewhat controversial. It is unlikely that the radiation-induced cognitive impairment observed 6 months or more after fWBI is a direct result of acute proinflammatory responses in the microglia alone. However, brain irradiation clearly leads to chronic, persistent increases in activated microglia; the resultant neuroinflammation has been associated with decreased neurogenesis and impaired neuronal function. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which radiation alters the microglia cell phenotype, and how PPARdelta agonists might prevent/ameliorate these changes, offers the promise of identifying potential interventions that can be evaluated in vivo. Moreover, since PPARdelta activation has been shown to regulate inflammation in multiple cell types and promote the survival of neurons under stress conditions, it is possible that PPARdelta can mitigate radiation-induced brain injury in multiple cell types. Additionally, animal studies have demonstrated that PPARdelta agonists can cross the blood brain barrier and modulate oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory responses associated with acute and chronic CNS disorders. Overall, our current in vitro findings indicate that PPARdelta activation shows promise as a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment and/or prevention of radiation-induced brain injury.

Proposed model outlining the role of PPARdelta in the modulation of the radiation-induced proinflammatory response in BV-2 cells.  Irradiation of BV-2 cells leads to an increase in intracellular ROS generation. This increases activation of the stress-activated kinases, PKCalpha, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, and the proinflammatory transcription factors, NF-kappaB and AP-1. Activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 enhance the expression of Cox-2, MCP-1, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha. PPARdelta activation prevents radiation-induced neuroinflammation, in part, by transrepression of NF-kappaB by physical interaction with the p65 subunit. Additionally, PPARdelta inhibits intracellular ROS generation, which prevents PKCalpha, MEK, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and downstream activation of AP-1.
