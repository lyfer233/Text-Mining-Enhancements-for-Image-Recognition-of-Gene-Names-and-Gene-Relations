 PROTEASE MEDIATED HUMAN SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL PROLIFERATION BY UROKINASE REQUIRES EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR TRANSACTIVATION BY TRIPLE MEMBRANE SIGNALING. Background. Urokinase [uPA] modulates cellular and extracellular matrix responses within the microenvironment of the vessel wall and has been shown to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]. This study examines the role of the protease domain of uPA during EGFR activation in human vascular smooth muscle cells [VSMC]. Methods. Human coronary VSMC were cultured in vitro. Assays of cell proliferation and EGFR phosphorylation were examined in response to the C-terminal fragment of uPA [CTF] in the presence and absence of the plasmin, metalloprotease [MMP] and A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase [ADAM] inhibitors, heparin-bound epidermal growth factor [HB-EGF], and EGFR inhibitors, and small interfering RNA [siRNA] to EGFR and ADAMs. Results. CTF produced a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in human VSMC, which was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by both plasmin inhibitors and the EGFR inhibitor, AG1478. CTF induced time-dependent EGFR phosphorylation, which was blocked by inhibitors of plasmin and MMP activity. The presence of uPAR was not required. Inhibition of ADAM-10 and -12, and of HB-EGF blocked EGFR activation in response to CTF. CTF-mediated activation of EGFR was mediated through Gbetagamma, src and NAD[P]H oxidase. Conclusions. In human coronary VSMC, uPA induces uPAR-independent, domain-dependent smooth muscle cell proliferation through transactivation of EGFR by a plasmin-mediated, ADAM-induced, HB-EGF-dependent process, which is mediated by the intracellular pathways involving Galphai, Gbetagamma, src and NAD[P]H oxidase. INTRODUCTION. Vessel remodeling occurs in response to flow and injury through an integrative program of cell proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix modulation. The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells [VSMC] involves the complex regulation of proteases, integrins and extracellular molecules. Urokinase plasminogen activator [uPA] is a serine protease that is the primary plasminogen activator involved in tissue remodeling processes. Elevated uPA and decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1] levels are predictors for angiographic coronary restenosis. After injury to the rat carotid artery, there is a time-dependent enhanced expression of plasminogen activators and increased plasminogen activator activity on smooth muscle cells within the vessel wall compared to the uninjured state. Overexpression of uPA or a deficiency of PAI-1 in transgenic mice has been shown to promote neointimal formation in response to transmural electrical injury. A lack of uPA or plasminogen leads to a reduction in neointimal hyperplasia. uPA binds to the cell membrane through a GPI-tailed receptor, uPAR. uPA has been shown to induce domain-dependent cell proliferation and migration, with the former due to its carboxyterminal, protease-containing domain [CTF] and the latter due to its aminoterminal, growth factor-binding domain. The biological data from the transgenic murine models suggests that uPA has a significant role in stimulating proliferation, and that it is plasmin dependent. Using mutants of single chain uPA [sc-uPA], others have shown that cell proliferation is dependent on the mutant sc-uPA molecules containing CTF. CTF contains a protease domain and leads to plasmin generation, while plasmin inhibition reduces DNA synthesis. Plasmin will induce VSMC proliferation and inhibition of plasmin's protease activity inhibits VSMC proliferation. Plasmin can activate metalloproteinases [MMP], which, in turn, may lead to epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] activation. We have recently demonstrated that uPA induces smooth muscle cell proliferation through ERK1/2 and p38MAPK-mediated pathways and is dependent on EGFR transactivation. CTF, through its protease domain or through generation of plasmin, may also activate G protein-coupled protease activated receptors on the cell membrane. Receptor transactivation is the pathway whereby activation of a given G protein-coupled receptor [GPCR] activates a heterologous receptor-linked tyrosine kinase [RTK]. At present, the triple membrane passing signaling [TMPS] mechanism of GPCR-induced EGFR activation is a widely accepted model of RTK transactivation. In this model, there is a sequence of three transmembrane signaling events: GPCR activation, followed by MMP activation and subsequent activation of EGFR by the tethered ligand heparin binding-EGF [HB-EGF] or other latent ligands of EGFR. Activation of the MMP step has been shown to involve one or more of the following signaling molecules: src, calcium, Pyk2 and protein kinase C [PKC]. This study tests the hypothesis that the protease domain of uPA induces cell proliferation through the triple membrane passing signaling mechanism in human VSMC, leading to transactivation of EGFR, and that this is independent of uPAR. METHODS. Experimental Design. Human coronary arterial VSMCs were cultured in vitro [passage 3-6; Clontech, Mountain View, CA]. Assays of cellular DNA synthesis and proliferation, EGFR phosphorylation, and MAPK activation were examined in response to CTF in the presence and absence of a general protease inhibitor [1, 10-phenanthrolene], plasmin inhibitors [epsilon-aminocaproic acid and aprotinin], a matrix metalloproteinase [MMP] inhibitor [GM6001], ADAM inhibitors [TAPI-0 and TAPI-1], HB-EGF inhibitor [CRM197], HB-EGF antibodies and an EGFR inhibitor [AG1478]. Additional experiments were performed with small interfering RNA [siRNA] to EGFR. We further examined intracellular pathways leading to EGFR phosphorylation with specific inhibitors: pertussis toxin [PTx] and GP-2A for Galphai and Galphaq, respectively; beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (carboxy terminus) [betaARKCT] for Gbetagamma; PP2 for src; H7 and GF109203X for PKC; BAPTA-AM, a chelator of intracellular calcium; N-acetylcysteine [NAC] as a free radical scavenger; and diphenyleneiodium [DPI] and apocynin as NAD[P]H inhibitors [Table 1]. Materials. CTF was purchased from American Diagnostica, Inc. [Greenwich, CT]. EGF was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. [St. Louis, MO]. AG1478 and CRM197 were purchased from Calbiochem [La Jolla, CA]. GM6001 was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. [Temecula, CA]. CRM197, TAPI-0 and TAPI-1 were purchased from Biomol [Hamburg, Germany]. The anti-HB-EGF antibody was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. [Minneapolis, MN]. The anti-EGFR antibody [151-IgG] developed by Dr. Ann Hubbard was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and maintained by The University of Iowa [Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA]. Pertussis toxin, GP2A, AG1478, PP3, PP2, H7, GF109203X, BAPTA-AM, NAC, apocynin and DPI were purchased from Calbiochem [La Jolla, CA]. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody [raised in goat] was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. [West Grove, PA]. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody [raised in goat] was purchased from Biorad Laboratories [Hercules, CA]. Phospho- EGFR [Y1068], Total EGFR antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. [Beverley, MA]. Dulbecco's modified Eagle minimal essential medium [DMEM] and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline were purchased from Mediatech [Herndon, VA]. [3H] Thymidine Incorporation. VSMC were allowed to reach ~70% confluence as judged by microscopic examination. The cells were then placed in DMEM for 2 days to induce a quiescent state in the cells. The experiments were initiated by adding [3H]-thymidine [1 muCi/mL; ICN, Irvine, CA] with and without pharmacological inhibitors, and stimulating the cells with CTF [10 nM]. Incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into acid-precipitable material was measured after a 24- hour incubation period [air plus 5% CO2 at 37 C]. Stimulation was expressed as fold increa se over starved cells [DMEM only], and the effects of inhibitors were expressed as percentage of the stimulated control. Cell Proliferation. Culture wells [24-well cluster dishes, Falcon] were inoculated with 3 mL growth medium containing 5x104 VSMC and allowed to attach overnight. Cell proliferation in response to CTF [10 nM] with and without pharmacological inhibitors was determined. Cell counts were determined on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Cells from each well were removed by trypsinization and the resultant suspension counted using a hemocytometer [Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA]. Proliferation was expressed as fold increase over unstimulated cells [DMEM only]. Western Blotting. VSMC were allowed to grow to 80% confluence and starved for 48 hours. Cells were then stimulated with CTF or EGF alone and in the presence of pharmacological and peptide inhibitors; cells were harvested at time points from 0 to 30 minutes. Western blotting was performed as previously described. siRNA Transfection. Pre-designed HPLC-purified siRNA for gene knockdown for EGFR or control siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology [Santa Cruz, CA]. siRNA sequences for ADAMs were as follows: ADAM9, AAUCACUGUGGAGACAUUUGCdTdT and AAACUUCC AGUGUGUAGAUGCdTdT; ADAM10, AAUGAAGAGGGACACUUCCCUdTdT and AAGUUGCCUCCUCCUAAACCAdTdT; and ADAM12 AACCUCGCUGCAAAGAAUGUGdTdT and AAGACCUUGATACGACUGCUGdTdT. VSMC of 50% confluence in 60-mm plates were starved overnight in 4 mL Opti-MEM reduced serum medium [Gibco]. siRNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 from Invitrogen, Inc. [Carlsbad, CA] following the product protocol. Briefly, 22 muL of Lipofectamine 2000 was first incubated in a total volume of 250 muL of Opti-MEM for 5 minutes at room temperature. This was then added to 250 muL of Opti-MEM containing 440 pmoles of siRNA. The solution was mixed gently and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature, after which it was added to the starved plates. The medium can was changed after 4-6 hours of incubation. The cells were used between 24-72 hours after transfection for EGFR assays. Scrambled siRNA served as a control. Using the methodologies described, we conducted concentration-dependent experiments with siRNA against EGFR and demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in protein expression that was specific for the protein targeted without altering the expression of the other proteins. Adenoviral Infection. Adenoviral vectors were constructed by Welgen, Inc. [Worcester, MA] using purified plasmid encoding betaARKCT, obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center [Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO]. VSMC were plated at 70% confluence in 100-mm dishes and allowed to grow overnight. Recombinant adenovirus was then added at the appropriate concentrations [betaARKCT; 50 MOI] in a reduced volume of media [1.5 - 2 mL]. After 48-hour incubation, the media was changed and cells grown for an additional 24 hours. The cells were then used for EGFR assays. Empty vector served as control. Data and Statistical Analysis. All data are presented as the mean +- standard error of the mean [s.e.m.] and statistical differences between groups were tested with a Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test with post hoc Dunn's multiple comparison correction, where appropriate. A p-value less than 0.05 was regarded as significant. Non-significant p-values were expressed as p=ns. RESULTS. Cell proliferation. CTF produces an increase in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation of the VSMC. Responses to CTF were blocked by the EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that EGFR is involved in these responses [Figure 1A and 1B]. DNA synthesis in response to EGF and HB-EGF were also inhibited by the presence of AG1478 [Figure 1A]. EGFR activation. Given the findings that CTF induced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in an EGFR-dependent manner, we examined the activation of EGFR by CTF. CTF induced time-dependent EGFR phosphorylation [Figure 2A], which was inhibited by AG1478 in a concentration-dependent manner [Figure 2B]. Activation of EGFR by EGF and HB-EGF was also inhibited by AG1478 [Figure 2C and 2D]. Incubation with siRNA to EGFR also inhibited the response to CTF, EGF and HB-EGF in the cells [Figure 2E and 2F]. Activation of EGFR was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of EGFR and immunoblotting for phosphotyrosine. Removal of uPAR by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C did not alter the proliferative response [Figure 2G]. Extracellular Pathway leading to EGFR activation. Protease activity is involved in EGFR transactivation. We examined EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of a general protease inhibitor and inhibitors of plasmin and metalloproteinases. EGFR phosphorylation by CTF was blocked by the general protease inhibitor, 1-10 phenanthrolene, and by inhibitors of plasmin activation, EACA and aprotinin [Figure 3A and 3B]. The metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM6001, also blocked EGFR activation by CTF [Figure 3A and 3B]. These inhibitors have no effect on EGF-mediated EGFR phosphorylation [Figure 3C]. The non specific ADAM inhibitors TAPI-0 and TAPI-1 also reduced EGFR activation in response to CTF but did not interrupt EGF activation of EGFR [Figure 3B, 3C and 3D]. As CTF-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR is inhibited by MMP and ADAM inhibitors, this suggests that EGFR activation by CTF requires MMP cleavage of a tethered ligand such as HB-EGF. Pre-incubation with CRM197, an inhibitor of HB-EGF, was able to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation in response to CTF [Figure 3E and 3F]. We confirmed this finding through the use of HB-EGF-blocking antibodies [Figure 3E and 3F]. We have already demonstrated that EGF is capable of inducing EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of each of these inhibitors. Incubation with antibodies against the EGFR receptor prevented both CTF and EGF-mediated EGFR phosphorylation [Figure 3E and 3F]. The protease inhibitors did not affect the activation of EGFR by HB-EGF but those inhibitors that target HB-EGF did inhibit the responses appropriately [Figure 3]. These findings suggest that EGFR phosphorylation is dependent on the protease activity and subsequent MMP-mediated shedding of HB-EGF. A likely target of these intermediate kinases is the ADAM [A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase Domain] family of MMPs, which are transmembrane molecules. VSMC express ADAM-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-12. We examined their contribution to EGFR activation by the use of siRNA to ADAM-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-12. siRNA reduced ADAM-9, -10, -12 proteins levels by >50%. Incubation with siRNA against ADAM -10 and ADAM-12 significantly reduced EGFR activation in response to CTF. Scrambled siRNA and siRNA against ADAM-9 had no effect [Figure 3H]. There was no effect on EGF and HB-EGF activation of EGFR [Figure 3H]. Intracellular Pathway leading to EGFR activation. An alternative method for activation of surface MMPs and subsequent release of a tethered ligand may be through G protein-coupled receptor activation. These receptors are coupled to Galphai/ Galphaq and Gbetagamma proteins. Pre-incubation with the Galphai inhibitor, pertussis toxin, resulted in inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation in response to CTF, while the Galphaq inhibitor, GP-2A, had no effect [Figure 4A and 4B]. The activation of EGFR by EGF was unaffected by these inhibitors [Figure 4A and 4C]. Pre-incubation with betaARKCT, a peptide that functions as a Gbetagamma protein inhibitor, resulted in a decreased EGFR phosphorylation in response to CTF [Figure 4A and 4B]. Many GPCRs utilize intracellular calcium, src, PKC and oxygen free radical generation to induce HB-EGF release and EGFR phosphorylation. Inhibition of intracellular calcium or src but not PKC blocked EGFR activation in response to CTF [Figure 4D and 4E]. The activation of EGFR by EGF was unaffected by these inhibitors [Figure 4D and 4F]. Inhibition of oxygen free radical production through either the general inhibitor NAC and the more specific inhibitors DPI and apocynin also decreased EGFR activation in response to CTF but not in response to EGF [Figure 4G and 4H]. The proposed pathway defined by these experiments is shown in Figure 5. DISCUSSION. We have shown that uPA induces smooth muscle cell proliferation through both ERK1/2 and p38MAPK-mediated pathways and have demonstrated that there is a distinct difference between uPA and plasmin with regard to the signaling pathways utilized to induce cell proliferation. Plasmin appears only to use ERK1/2, while uPA uses both ERK1/2 and p38MAPK. In this report, we use the protease domain of uPA, CTF, to examine the problem more specifically and demonstrate for the first time that CTF-dependent smooth muscle cell proliferation occurs through transactivation of EGFR by a plasmin-mediated, ADAM-induced, HB-EGF-dependent process, which required activation of the intracellular pathways Galphai/Gbetagamma, src and NAD[P]H oxidase. Rather than signaling through uPAR, the CTF requires a G protein-coupled receptor to activate this cascade; this may occur through its protease domain directly or through generation of plasmin. Our results suggest these actions may activate G protein-coupled protease activated receptors on the cell membrane that signal through ARK1, since the ARK1 inhibitor betaARKCT prevents CTF-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR. Transmembrane molecules such as ADAM are attractive candidate molecules for the transmembrane portion of the signaling pathway. ADAMs are approximately 70 to 90 kDa [mature proteins; the unprocessed precursors are about 20 kDa larger due to their prodomain]. They feature a common modular ectodomain structure, encompassing a variable stalk region; a cysteine-rich domain; a disintegrin domain binding to integrin-class cell adhesion molecules; and a Zn-binding metalloprotease domain. ADAM-9, ADAM-10, ADAM-12 and ADAM-17 have been reported to be involved in the ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF. We have shown that VSMC express ADAM-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-12. Furthermore, we have recently identified that during migration the predominant pathways that lead to HB-EGF release are ADAM-9 and ADAM-10 dependent in these particular VSMC. This study suggests that in proliferation ADAM-10 and ADAM-12 are involved. The ErbB-1/EGFR consists of a glycosylated ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain and is expressed in the injured vessel wall. HB-EGF is a tethered ligand for EGFR whose cleavage is MMP dependent and can be inhibited with heparin. Our data using CRM197 and antibodies against HB-EGF and EGFR support the fact that an extracellular pathway using HB-EGF is required for CTF-mediated EGFR activation. Activation of HB-EGF requires that it be cleaved from the membrane and also requires cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans to act as a co-receptors; HB-EGF binding to EGFR can be antagonized in a dose-dependent manner by heparin. We also demonstrated that this pathway was protease dependent and in particular dependent on metalloproteinase activity. We further extended these findings to demonstrate that ADAMs were involved. This sequence of events utilizes classical extracellular pathways of receptor transactivation whereby activation of a given receptor activates a heterologous receptor. In this model, there is a sequence of three transmembrane signaling events: G protein-coupled receptor activation, followed by ADAM-dependent MMP activation, and then cleavage of and subsequent binding of HB-EGF to the EGFR receptor. ADAM-10, ADAM-12 and ADAM-17 [TNF-alpha converting enzyme] have been shown to cleave HB-EGF. Activation of the ADAM pathway has been shown to involve one or more of the following signaling molecules: src, intracellular calcium, and/or protein kinase C. An alternative mechanism may be inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases due to the generation of oxygen free radicals by the NAD[P]H oxidase complex. As with all cell signaling experiments, one must realize that the in vitro analysis does not completely represent the in vivo circumstance due to the fact that the in vivo VSMC is encased in a changing extracellular matrix and is under constant fluctuating hemodynamic and inflammatory forces. When we examine the pathways leading EGFR activation, one must accept that there are redundant pathways (extracellular and intracellular) that may mediate the effects of SMC proliferation and that these could be stimulated by other growth factors/upstream pathways. Conclusion. In human coronary VSMC, urokinase induces uPAR-independent, domain-dependent smooth muscle cell proliferation through transactivation of EGFR by a plasmin-mediated, ADAM-induced HB-EGF-dependent process, which is mediated by the intracellular pathways involving Galphai, Gbetagamma, src and NAD[P]H oxidase.

CTF interacts with a G protein-coupled receptor which activates activates both Galphai and Gbetagamma. In turn, a series of intracellular molecules are involved which lead to activation of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase Domains (ADAM) proteases (ADAM-10 and ADAM-12). Activation of ADAM-associated MMP activity leads to release of the tethered ligand, HB-EGF, which in turn activates the EGFR. Activation of EGFR is necessary for CTF-mediated proliferation.
