 FOXO1-AMPK-ULK1 Regulates Ethanol-induced Autophagy in Muscle by Enhanced ATG14 Association with the BECN1-PIK3C3 Complex. Background. Excessive alcohol (EtOH) consumption causes imbalances in protein metabolism. EtOH impairs protein synthesis in C2C12 myoblasts via a FoxO1-AMPK-TSC2-mTORC1 pathway and also induces degradation. As the underlying regulatory signaling cascades for these processes are currently poorly defined, we tested the hypothesis that alcohol-induced autophagy is mediated via activation of the PIK3C3 complex that is regulated by FoxO1-AMPK. Methods. C2C12 myoblasts were incubated with EtOH for various periods of time and autophagy pathway-related proteins were assessed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Expression of targeted genes was suppressed using electroporation of specific siRNAs and chemical inhibitors. Results. Incubation of C2C12 myoblasts with 100 mM EtOH increased the autophagy markers LC3B-II and ATG7, whereas levels of SQSTM1/p62 decreased. The lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycinA1 caused a similar response, although there was no additive effect when combined with ETOH. EtOH altered ULK1 S555 and S757 phosphorylation in a time- and AMPK-dependent manner. The activation of AMPK and ULK1 was associated with increased BECN1 (S93, S14) and PIK3C3/VPS34 (S164) phosphorylation as well as increased total ATG14 and PIK3C3. These changes promoted formation of the ATG14-AMBRA1-BECN1-PIK3C3 pro-autophagy complex that is important in autophagosome formation. EtOH-induced changes were not associated with increased production of PtdIns3P, which may be due to enhanced PIK3C3 complex binding with 14-3-3Theta. Reduction of AMPK using siRNA suppressed the stimulatory effect of EtOH on BECN1 S93, S14 and PIK3C3 S164 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Likewise, knockdown of AMPK or chemical inhibition of FoxO1 attenuated phosphorylation of ULK1 at both residues. Knockdown of ULK1 or BECN1 antagonized the effect of EtOH on LC3B-II, SQSTM1and ATG7 protein expression. Conclusions. EtOH-induced autophagy is mediated through changes in phosphorylation and interaction of various PIK3C3 complex components. This, in turn, is regulated either directly via FoxO1-AMPK, or indirectly via the FoxO1-AMPK-ULK1 signaling cascade in a mTORC1-independent or-dependent manner. INTRODUCTION. Excessive alcohol (ethanol; EtOH) consumption causes diverse metabolic and functional changes in skeletal and cardiac muscle. A hallmark of prolonged alcohol abuse is the loss of lean body mass arising from an impairment in protein balance as evidenced by the decrease in protein synthesis and/or increase in protein degradation. Previously, EtOH was shown to decrease protein synthesis in C2C12 mouse myoblasts, whereas its effect on global protein degradation in these cells was equivocal. However, recent data suggest that EtOH can increase muscle protein breakdown at least in part by stimulating lysosomal autophagy, but the underlying signaling mechanisms have not been fully defined. Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a catabolic system that delivers cytoplasmic content (protein, lipid, organelles) to the lysosome for degradation. Activation of autophagy in response to various stress conditions is an essential mechanism maintaining cell viability. As such, autophagy is a highly regulated process and is central in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Autophagy also plays a central role in development, tissue remodeling, and is altered in a number of human diseases of striated muscle. Multistep processes coordinate the action of various autophagy-related (ATG) proteins on Unc-51 like kinase-1 (ULK1) and vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34/PIK3C3) complexes. These proteins, in turn, function as important regulators of autophagy initiation and progression. PIK3C3 complex is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PtdIns3K) implicated as a critical regulator for a number of cellular events including endocytic trafficking and autophagy. This protein is also involved in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in response to nutrient starvation. PIK3C3 phosphorylates the 3-posititon of phosphatidylinositol thereby producing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), a key membrane marker for both intracellular trafficking and autophagosome formation. The mammalian PIK3C3 protein resides in multiple complexes that are responsible for different cellular functions. Core components of various PIK3C3 complexes include PIK3C3, BECN1 and PIK3R4/p150 (vps15). BECN1 participates in PIK3C3 complex formation and recruits additional proteins including ATG14/Barkor (BECN1-associated autophagy-related key regulator), ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) and the activating molecule in BECN1-regulated autophagy (AMBRA-1). These ATG14, UVRAG or AMBRA1 containing complexes each function as a positive regulator of BECN1-PIK3C3 complexes and have important roles in autophagy. Additionally, Bif1, VMP1 and Rubicon have also been reported as components of the PIK3C3 complex, suggesting that many different PIK3C3 complexes exist that can potentially impact cellular function. The PIK3C3 complex is regulated via phosphorylation events that ultimately affect its interaction with various accessory proteins. Thus, in response to stress, the composition of the PIK3C3 complex depends upon which components are phosphorylated. For example, with glucose deprivation, phosphorylation of BECN1 at serine (S) 91/S94 activates the pro-autophagic PIK3C3 complex containing ATG14 or UVRAG. These complexes mediate autophagosome formation and maturation, respectively. Conversely, phosphorylation of PIK3C3 at S164 inhibits the non-autophagic PIK3C3 complex, thereby suppressing PtdIns3P production. Similar to situations involving energy stress, amino acid deprivation differentially regulates a PIK3C3 complex that activates autophagy, while coordinately inhibiting the non-autophagic complex. This induction does not require BECN1 phosphorylation at S93, suggesting an additional mechanism is involved in PIK3C3 regulation. In contrast, amino acid starvation enhances S14-phosphorylation of BECN1. At present, the precise role that PIK3C3 complexes play in EtOH-induced autophagy remains undefined. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a major sensor of nutrient and cellular energy status that is activated under stress conditions (e.g., hypoxia, glucose withdrawal, EtOH). Signaling from AMPK regulates the autophagy pathway and data from independent studies indicate AMPK regulates nutrient- and alcohol-induced autophagy via phosphorylation of ULK1. Furthermore, while AMPK regulates multiple PIK3C3 complexes following glucose deprivation, the role of AMPK in regulating PIK3C3 complexes as a mechanism underlying EtOH-induced autophagy in muscle is unknown. Previously, we reported EtOH enhances AMPK phosphorylation and activity, while concurrently inhibiting mTORC1 function and protein synthesis. Although recent studies showed that forkhead box 3a (FoxO3a) is a key factor in regulating EtOH and stress-induced autophagy in cultured hepatocytes and other tissues, it is unclear whether this signaling cascade regulates the process in muscle. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that alcohol-induced autophagy in myoblasts is mediated via activation of the PIK3C3 complex that is regulated by the activation of AMPK. Our data reveal that EtOH activates the pro-autophagy ATG14-PIK3C3 complex by increasing BECN1 phosphorylation (S14 and S93) and ATG14 levels. In parallel, EtOH inhibits the non-autophagy PIK3C3 complex by enhancing total PIK3C3 and PIK3C3 (S164) phosphorylation. EtOH-induced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ULK1 at S555 and S757 alters the interaction between AMPK and ULK1, and increases the association of ULK1 with BECN1, ATG14 and PIK3C3. Stimulation of autophagy by EtOH is regulated by FoxO1-AMPK signaling which mediates its effects via activation of ULK1 and ATG14-containing PIK3C3 complexes. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Materials. EtOH was purchased from Fisher Scientific Co. (Springfield, NJ). Antibodies against phosphorylated (p)-ULK1 (S555), p-ULK1 (S757) and p-BECN1 (S93) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). LC3B, LC3A, ATG7, ATG12-5, SQSTM1/p62, total PIK3C3 and beta-actin were from the same source with the latter serving as a control for equal protein loading of samples. The p-BECN1 (S15) antibody was from Abbiotec (San Diego, CA). The mouse (m) AMPKalpha1/2, BECN1 (m), ULK1 (m) siRNA, scrambled siRNA as well as antibodies against 14-3-3Theta and AMBRA1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas). Antibody to ATG14 was from Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., LTD (Woburn, MA) and PIK3C3-p-34 (S164) was purchased from Biorbyt (San Francisco, CA). The AMPK inhibitor Compound C and FoxO1 inhibitor AS1842856 were from EMD Millipore Corporation (Billerica, MA). Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), bafilomycin A1, protease, and phosphatase I and II inhibitor cocktails were from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Mediatech, Inc (Manassas, VA). Cell cultures and transfection. C2C12 mouse myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 mug/ml) and amphotericin (25 mug/ml) at 37  C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated on 6-well or 10 cm dishes and grown to confluence. All studies were conducted using cells at the early passage (P3-P7) of the myoblast stage. Upon confluence, cells were treated with 100 mM EtOH as previously described and harvested after 1 h unless otherwise indicated. A concentration of 100 mM EtOH was used because it produces an optimal effect on protein synthesis without being cytotoxic to myoblasts. During the incubation, plates were sealed with parafilm to minimize the evaporation of EtOH. Myoblasts were used because of the difficulty in effectively transfecting fully differentiated myotubes which was necessary for pursuing mechanistic studies. For transient expression, the siRNA target or scrambled sequences were transfected into C2C12 myoblasts by electroporation (Amaxa Biosystems nucleofector II, Germany) and the Amaxa cell line nucleofector kit V (Lonza Walkersville Inc., Walkersville, MD). All transfections were performed following the manufactures' protocol. Experiments were carried out 48 h post-transfection and cells were harvested thereafter for immunoblot analysis. Drug treatment. For studies using the FoxO1 or lysosomal inhibitors, myoblasts were pre-treated as noted in the figure legends. The concentration and incubation times for reagents were chosen based on dose- and time-response curves derived from our preliminary studies and the literature. Total protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent (BCA) protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The data were normalized and expressed as a percentage of the appropriate time-matched control value. PtdIns3K activity assay. PIK3C3 complex activity was determined using a PtdIns3K Elisa kit from Echelon Biosciences (Salt Lake City, UT) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, PtdIns3K was immunoprecipitated from control and EtOH-treated cell lysates utilizing anti-PIK3C3 or ATG14 antibodies. In these experiments phosphatidylinositol was used as substrate and the activity was monitored for the detection of PtdIns3P production. Autophagic detection. Autophagic activity in myoblasts was measured using a Cyto-ID autophagy detection kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells expressing a GFP-LC3 fusion protein were visually monitored using a Leica SP8 scanning confocal microscope (Heidelberg, Germany), thereby allowing for the observation of fluorescence in vesicles produced during autophagy. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. C2C12 myoblasts, cultured in either 10 cm or 6-well plates, were incubated in the presence of EtOH and/or various reagents (bafilomycin A1 or FoxO1 inhibitor). Thereafter, cells were rinsed once with PBS and lysed in ice-cold 0.3% CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamindopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) buffer containing PMSF and a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Soluble fractions of cell extracts were isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4  C. For immunoprecipitation (IP), a 1:75 dilution of primary antibody (Ab) was added to equal amounts of protein (300-500 mug) from cell lysates and rotated overnight at 4  C. A total of 50 mul of a 50% slurry of protein A sepharose was then added for an additional 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and the precipitated proteins were denatured by the addition of 2x Laemmli sample buffer (LSB). Equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes. The resulting blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with the antibodies of interest (1:500-1000). Unbound primary antibody was removed by washing with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (ICI Americas, Inc, Wilmington, DE) and blots were incubated with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:3000) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). On occasions where the denatured and reduced rabbit IgG light or heavy chains obscured protein bands of similar molecular weights, mouse anti-rabbit IgG (conformation specific L27A9) mAb (Cell Signaling) was added as a bridging antibody prior to incubation with an anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked secondary antibody (Cell Signaling). Blots were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and exposed to X-ray blue film (Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) or the FluroChem M multifluor system was used for visualization (Proteinsimple, Santa Clara, CA) and quantified with Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Statistical analysis. For experimental protocols with more than two groups, statistical significance was determined using one- or two-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett's post-hoc test. For experiments with only two groups, an unpaired Student's t-test was performed. Data are presented as mean +- SEM of multiple (3-5 times) repeated experiments with 3-4 samples per experiment. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS. Autophagy markers. Although EtOH increases autophagy in various cell types and tissues, the signaling cascades that regulate EtOH-induced autophagic responses in muscle cells have not been fully defined. In initial experiments, we verified the effects of EtOH on protein levels of known autophagy markers. Incubation of myoblasts with 100 mM EtOH for various times increased LC3B lipidation (LC3B-II) by ~ 60% as compared to time-matched controls (Fig. 1A). Likewise, an enhanced fluorescent signal of LC3B-II was observed following EtOH exposure using confocal fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 1, B and C). EtOH increased the amount of both LC3A-II (an isoform of LC3B) and ATG7, while ATG12-5 protein expression did not differ between control and EtOH-treated cells. Conversely, EtOH decreased SQSMT1 (sequestosome 1)/p62 protein relative to control values (Fig. 1, D and E). AMPK and FoxO1 mediate EtOH-induced changes in LC3B and SQSMT1. AMPK and the transcription factor FoxO3a are involved in regulating autophagy under starvation conditions as well as following EtOH exposure. Previously, we reported that AMPK and FoxO1 mediate the effects of EtOH on various signal transduction pathways. As such, EtOH increases both AMPK and FoxO1 activity towards a number of downstream targets that regulate protein synthesis and extracellular matrix components. To determine whether EtOH-induced changes in LC3B-II and SQSMT1 levels are regulated by AMPK, myoblasts were transfected with scrambled siRNA or a AMPKalpha1/2 siRNA. The selection of AMPKalpha1/2 siRNA was based on results from previous studies where we immune-isolated AMPKalpha1/2 for in vitro kinase assays. Knockdown of AMPK with siRNA resulted in a  60% decline in the amount of AMPK, compared to scrambled control values (Fig. 2A). While partial silencing of AMPK did not alter basal LC3B-II levels, the EtOH-induced increase in LC3B-II was prevented and the relative expression of LC3B-II was lower than scrambled control values (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar results were obtained when myoblasts were treated with the AMPK inhibitor compound C in the presence or absence of EtOH (data not shown). In addition, knockdown of AMPK prevented the EtOH-induced decrease in SQSMT1 (Fig. 2, B and D). Next, we examined whether FoxO1 is involved in the regulation of EtOH-induced autophagy, as determined using our two autophagy markers. Incubation of myoblasts with a FoxO1 inhibitor did not alter the amount of basal LC3B-II (Fig. 2, E and F). However, this agent completely suppressed the stimulatory effect of EtOH, with LC3B-II levels remaining below control values. Likewise, this drug blocked the inhibitory effect of EtOH on SQSMT1 (Fig. 2, E and G). Collectively, these data demonstrate that both AMPK and FoxO1 are involved in the regulation of EtOH-induced autophagy in C2C12 myoblasts. PIK3C3 and BECN1 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation events affect the formation of distinct PI3K complexes that either promote or inhibit autophagy. Following energy starvation, phosphorylation of BECN1 at S91/94 promotes the ATG14-containing pro-autophagy PIK3C3 complex, whereas phosphorylation of PIK3C3 at S164 blocks formation of the non-autophagy complex. Conversely, phosphorylation of S91/94 is not necessary for the induction of pro-autophagy PIK3C3 complexes in response to amino acid deprivation. Hence, we examined whether the EtOH-induced autophagy is associated with changes in the phosphorylation of BECN1 and PIK3C3. Incubation of myoblasts with EtOH rapidly increased BECN1 phosphorylation on S93 and S14 compared to control values (Fig. 3A). The increase in BECN1 S93 phosphorylation was transient, whereas S14 phosphorylation remained elevated up to 1 h. EtOH also increased phosphorylation of PIK3C3 at S164 in myoblasts for at least 1 h (Fig. 3B). The observed phosphorylation changes were independent of alterations in total BECN1 levels, although EtOH did increase the total amount of both ATG14 and PIK3C3 (Fig. 3C). PIK3C3 interaction and binding with AMPK. Next, we determined whether EtOH-induced changes in PIK3C3 and BECN1 phosphorylation were associated with alterations in protein-protein interactions known to mediate downstream signaling events. Incubation of myoblasts with EtOH increased the association of PIK3C3 with BECN1, ATG14 and the negative regulator 14-3-3 theta, as compared to untreated control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Enhanced binding of ATG14 with PIK3C3 and 14-3-3theta was also observed (Fig. 4, C and D). No interaction between BECN1 and UVRAG was detected (data not shown) because the presence of ATG14 and UVRAG in the same complex is mutually exclusive. EtOH increased the interaction of AMBRA1 with BECN1 and ATG14, while it decreased the binding between AMBRA1 and PIK3C3 (Fig. 4, E and F). Next, as assessed by an in vitro kinase assay, EtOH attenuated the PIK3C3 lipid kinase activity of immunoprecipitates isolated with antibodies against either ATG14 or PIK3C3 (Fig. 4G). Finally, we examined the interaction of the PIK3C3 complex with its upstream regulator AMPK. EtOH increased the interaction of AMPK with ATG14 and AMBRA1. In contrast, EtOH decreased the association between PIK3C3 and AMPK (Fig. 4, H and I). Together, these data suggest EtOH regulates the composition and activity of the PIK3C3 complex, changes mediated via the phosphorylation state of BECN1 and PIK3C3. BECN1 mediates EtOH effect on LC3B, ATG7 and SQSMT1. To further characterize the role that BECN1 plays in EtOH-induced autophagy, myoblasts were transfected with scrambled or BECN1 specific siRNA. BECN1 was decreased by 90% as compared to scrambled controls (Fig. 5A). This knockdown of BECN1 blunted the stimulatory effect of EtOH on LC3B lipidation, with the amount of LC3B-II remaining below control values (Fig. 5, B and C). Knockdown of BECN1 also prevented the EtOH-induced decrease in SQSMT1 (Fig. 5, B and D). Finally, the reduction in BECN1 antagonized the changes in ATG7 observed in response to EtOH, when compared to scrambled controls (Fig. 5, B and E). These results suggest a role for BECN1 and the PIK3C3 complex as upstream regulators of the ethanol-induced autophagy markers LC3B and SQSMT1. ULK1 phosphorylation and its interaction with PIK3C3 complex and AMPK. ULK1 contains multiple phosphorylation sites and is differentially regulated by upstream kinases acting on various residues in response to stress conditions. To determine whether EtOH-induced autophagy in myoblasts is mediated by ULK1 phosphorylation, we assessed the dynamics of phosphorylation at S757 and S555, sites that are involved in "cytoplasmic" autophagy and mitophagy, respectively. Incubation of cells with EtOH for 15 min increased ULK1 phosphorylation at S555, compared to control values (Fig. 6A). However, phosphorylation was suppressed when cells were subjected to extended treatment (1 h), and remained below control levels for up to 4 h (data not shown). In contrast, short-term treatment with EtOH decreased ULK1 phosphorylation at S757 (Fig. 6B), while increased phosphorylation at this residue was detected after 1 h and remained elevated for up to 3 h (data not shown). The total amount of ULK1 was not altered at the various time points. These changes in ULK1 phosphorylation were associated with alterations in protein-protein interaction, as EtOH increased the binding of ULK1 with BECN1, ATG14 and PIK3C3 when compared to untreated control cells (Fig. 6, C and D). The association of ULK1 with its upstream regulator AMPK was also modulated in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6, E and F). ULK1 knockdown attenuates EtOH effect on PIK3C3 and BECN1 phosphorylation. Because BECN1 is a direct target of ULK1 in cells subjected to stress conditions, we examined whether EtOH-induced changes in BECN1 and PIK3C3 phosphorylation were regulated by ULK1. Myoblasts were transfected with scrambled or ULK1-specific siRNA and cell extracts were collected. Knockdown of ULK1 with siRNA resulted in ~60% decrease in total ULK1, compared to scrambled control values (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, silencing of ULK1 attenuated the EtOH-induced increase in BECN1 phosphorylation at both S14 and S93 (Fig. 7, B, C and D), as well as the increase in PIK3C3 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B and E). These data suggest that ULK1 is an upstream regulator of the PIK3C3 complex in C2C12 myoblasts exposed to EtOH. ULK1 mediates EtOH effect on ATG7 and LC3B. To study the link between ULK1 and EtOH-induced autophagy, myoblasts were transfected with scrambled or ULK1-specific siRNA. Knockdown of ULK1 blocked the increase in LC3B-II (Fig. 8, A and B) and ATG7 (Fig. 8, A and C) in EtOH-treated cells, compared to scrambled control values. In contrast, reduction of ULK1 by siRNA did not alter the EtOH-induced decrease of SQSTM1 (Fig. 8, A and D). AMPK regulates BECN1, PIK3C3 and ULK1phosphorylation. To investigate whether the phosphorylation of BECN1, PIK3C3 and ULK1 was AMPK-dependent, myoblasts were transfected with scrambled or AMPKalpha1/2 siRNA. The knockdown of AMPK blunted the EtOH-induced increase of BECN1 (S93) phosphorylation after 15 min (Fig. 9, A and B). Likewise, partial silencing of AMPK prevented the EtOH-induced decrease at S93 BECN1 phosphorylation otherwise observed at 1 h (data not shown). In contrast, whereas AMPK knockdown did not affect the EtOH-induced increase in BECN1 (S14) phosphorylation at 15 min (Fig. 9, A and C), it did prevent the increase observed at the 1 h time point (Fig. 9, A and D). Reduction of AMPK by siRNA blocked EtOH-induced increases in PIK3C3 phosphorylation (Fig. 9, A and E). Comparable data were obtained when myoblasts were treated with the AMPK inhibitor Compound C (data not shown). These results suggest that phosphorylation of BECN1 S93 and PIK3C3 are directly regulated by AMPK at both time points, whereas phosphorylation of BECN1 at S14 was regulated at a later time (1 h) point. Together, these data indicate that AMPK regulates its downstream targets in a time-dependent manner. Finally, AMPK knockdown also prevented the EtOH-induced increase in ULK1 phosphorylation observed at S555, with levels remaining below those of scrambled controls (Fig. 9, A and F). The suppressive effect of EtOH on S757 at early time points was not affected by AMPK silencing (Fig. 9, A and G). However, knockdown of AMPK did block the increased S757 phosphorylation otherwise observed when myoblasts were incubated with EtOH for 1 h (Fig. 9, A and H). These data suggest AMPK regulates both the early (S555) and late (S757) EtOH-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1. DISCUSSION. We have previously reported that the FoxO1-sestrin3-AMPK signaling cascade mediates the ability of EtOH to inhibit mTOR function and protein synthesis in C2C12 myoblasts. Likewise, several studies have demonstrated a connection between AMPK and FoxO3a in the induction of autophagy, either under stress situations or following EtOH exposure. In the current study, we identified a role for AMPK and FoxO1 signaling in regulating autophagy in myoblasts. EtOH decreased SQSTM1, a selective autophagy adapter protein that recognizes and degrades a number of cargoes including organelles. For example, a reduction of SQSTM1 correlates with the induction of mitophagy in murine liver and in primary hepatocytes after alcohol. Our results are in agreement with previous studies using a variety of cell types subjected to starvation, hypoxia or EtOH. In contradistinction, other studies report that EtOH increases SQSTM1 levels in mouse liver, HepG2 cells, and heart muscle cells. These contrasting results are not unexpected because we and others have demonstrated differential effects of EtOH on AMPK-mTORC1 mediated signaling pathways in liver and muscle cells (,. The observed changes in LC3B-II and SQSTM1 were abolished in myoblasts in the presence of a FoxO1 inhibitor or when AMPK was decreased by siRNA, suggesting that both AMPK and FoxO1 are required to regulate EtOH-induced autophagy. Mechanistically, AMPK appears to mediate this effect via distinct kinase cascades, including ULK1 and the PIK3C3 complex. ULK1 is a key initiator of starvation-induced autophagy and contains several phosphorylation sites that can differentially affect cellular targets. For example, enhanced ULK1 phosphorylation at S555 increases mitophagy under energy stress conditions. The increased phosphorylation at this site, coupled with a reduction in SQSTM1 led us to speculate that EtOH enhances autophagy in myoblasts by specifically targeting organelles, such as mitochondria, as reported in other cell types. Furthermore, decreased ULK1 phosphorylation at S757 has been correlated with an induction of nonspecific autophagy as reported in studies during acute nutrient deprivation. ULK1 phosphorylation appears to be regulated by AMPK, as there was an EtOH-induced increase in the interaction of AMPK with ULK1. Furthermore, knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of FoxO1 prevented the stimulatory effect of EtOH on ULK1 phosphorylation. ULK1 can be regulated by either AMPK- or mTOR-dependent pathways, depending on which residues are phosphorylated. For example, the ability of EtOH to increase S555 phosphorylation appears to be regulated by AMPK, since ULK1 (S555) is a direct substrate of AMPK. Conversely, enhanced phosphorylation of ULK1 at S757 by cellular stress can be controlled by mTOR as part of the AMPK-TSC2-mTORC1 signaling cascade. In this regard, we previously reported that EtOH increases AMPK and decreases mTORC1 activity via the same pathway. Hence, the EtOH-mediated decrease in ULK1 S757 may be due to the coordinate decrease in mTOR activity via the AMPK-TSC2-mTORC1 dependent pathway. Together, our data suggest that changes in the phosphorylation state of ULK1 at S555 and S757 in response to EtOH are regulated by AMPK and FoxO1, and this may involve both mTORC1-dependent and-independent pathways. Phosphorylation of ULK1 by AMPK is important for the subsequent function of ULK1 in regulating downstream substrates including the PIK3C3 complex. Accumulating evidence indicates that alterations in phosphorylation and/or interaction of BECN1 and PIK3C3 are required for stress-induced autophagy. In the present study, EtOH-induced changes in BECN1 phosphorylation were associated with elevations in autophagy, as indicated by increased LC3B-II and decreased SQSTM1. The important role of BECN1 in EtOH-induced autophagy is further supported by the observation that knockdown of BECN1 blocked the EtOH-induced changes in LC3B, and SQSTM1. The EtOH-induced increase in BECN1 and PIK3C3 phosphorylation appears regulated by ULK1, as the interaction of this kinase with BECN1, ATG14 and PIK3C3 was increased. Likewise, siRNA knockdown of ULK1 prevented the effect of EtOH on BECN1 (S93, S14) and PIK3C3 (S164) phosphorylation. Moreover, decreasing AMPK by siRNA also prevented the phosphorylation of BECN1 (S93) phosphorylation and PIK3C3, consistent with reports whereby AMPK directly regulated BECN1 S93 upon glucose depletion. In contrast, knockdown of AMPK did not alter the short-term EtOH-induced increase in BECN1 S14 phosphorylation, a site regulated by ULK1 during amino acid starvation. Hence, EtOH-induced changes in the PIK3C3 complex are mediated either by AMPK or indirectly via ULK1 activation of different phosphorylated residues. Increased BECN1 phosphorylation functions to recruit PIK3C3-specific subunits, such as ATG14, UVRAG and AMBRA1, and forming a pro-autophagy PIK3C3 complex. The central role played by ATG14 and AMBRA1 is supported by data indicating that siRNA silencing of ATG14 or AMBRA1 reduces autophagosome nucleation. Likewise, down-regulation of AMBRA1 decreases the capacity of BECN1 to associate with PIK3C3 and reduces autophagy induction. Conversely, overexpression of ATG14/Barkor or AMBRA1 activates autophagy and increases the number of autophagosomes. Hence, the ability of EtOH to increase association of the pro-autophagic proteins ATG14 and AMBRA1 with BECN1-PIK3C3 complexes may be essential for autophagosome formation and autophagy initiation. On the other hand, the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 did not modulate the effect of EtOH on LC3B-II or SQSTM1 (data not shown). While this result is in agreement with a report examining HepG2 cells and liver from chronic alcohol-fed mice, it is in contrast to previous studies in myocytes where there was an additive effect of EtOH and lysosomal inhibitors. Although there is no clear explanation for this discrepancy, it may be due to differences in cell types and/or the inhibitors used in the respective studies. Therefore, it is possible that EtOH affects the key components of the early, rather than later, stages of the autophagy pathway. Collectively, our data indicate that enhanced phosphorylation and interaction of BECN1 with accessory proteins within the PIK3C3 complex can be regulated directly by AMPK or indirectly via ULK1. Activation of the PIK3C3 complex and synthesis of its product PtdIns3P are required for autophagosome formation and/or maturation during autophagy. Herein we demonstrated that EtOH decreased the amount of PtdIns3P, a result comparable to the starvation response. Hence, the reduction in PtdIns3P by EtOH may represent an important stress response involved in cell viability, whereby cells decrease metabolic activities associated with growth and differentiation. In this regard, the attenuation in PtdIns3P production may be due to an enhanced binding of the PIK3C3 complex with 14-3-3, a protein that negatively regulates the activity of the lipid kinase (Pozuelo-Rubio, 2011). This increased association appears regulated by an EtOH-induced decrease in the activity of protein phosphatase 2A towards AMPK, that increases AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of PIK3C3 thereby enhancing its binding with 14-3-3. Overall, these changes can have important consequences related to the survival of cells, some of which are associated with the suppression of apoptosis. We propose the following model for EtOH-induced autophagy in myoblasts based on data from the current study and the published literature (Fig. 10). EtOH-induced changes in LC3B lipidation, SQSTM1 and ATG7 are regulated by FoxO1-AMPK either directly by affecting the PIK3C3 complex, or indirectly via ULK1 and PIK3C3 complex cascades. This, in turn, is mediated by both mTORC1-independent and-dependent pathways. AMPK increases ULK1 function through direct phosphorylation of the S555 residue. Alternatively, AMPK can regulate ULK1 by inactivating mTORC1 through phosphorylation of TSC2 and raptor. Inhibition of mTORC1 is correlated with a decreased ULK1 S757 phosphorylation and increased activity. Regardless, AMPK enhances the activity of ULK1 to regulate its downstream targets BECN1 and PIK3C3. Phosphorylation of BECN1 serves to recruit ATG14 and AMBRA1 for the formation of the pro-autophagy complex that may play an important role in autophagosome formation. Phosphorylation of PIK3C3 appears to be involved in inhibition of the non-autophagy complex. Hence, our data provide greater insight into the molecular mechanisms by which EtOH regulates muscle protein homeostasis. DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

EtOH increases LC3B lipidation and decreases SQSTM1, with this process being mediated via multiple signaling cascades. EtOH stimulates FoxO1 activity, which increases the phosphorylation and function of AMPK. Upon activation, the PIK3C3 complex can be directly regulated by AMPK through phosphorylation of BECN1 (S93, S14) and PIK3C3 (S164). Alternatively, AMPK can affect ULK1 function to regulate its downstream target PIK3C3 complex through phosphorylation of BECN1 and PIK3C3 via a mTORC1-independent and dependent pathway. The activated PIK3C3 complex increases LC3B-II and ATG7 levels, as well as decreases SQSTM1.
